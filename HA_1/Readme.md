First Assigment Description

There was two hard tasks. First is to find data set for GPT2 training. I have tried to
find ready set what will contain some game devoted site, but I failed. So I write the
script what will search through common crawl index and upload specific site. As a
data set I have used the game blog https://www.kotaku.com . I wrote a parser for that
site. As output I had 220 MB of text.
My data set: https://drive.google.com/open?id=15h4-L8ZCCtSP2kxPEi-
5UMJyiIKd0ITA .
After I have used “Google colab” version of GPT2 what you have provided. I trained
345M model.
My output language models: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1932u2aiSw-
UhR0q5dSBi2xVob_wnBlDf .
Second huge issue was to make a video. I used several algorithms, but they had a
poor output. After I asked my group mates and Maks suggested to use face2face
algorithm: https://github.com/datitran/face2face-demo . That algorithm could give
good results, and also could be used on “Google colab”. So I decided to use that
algorithm instead of provided.
