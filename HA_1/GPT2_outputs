 will launch alongside Half-Life: Episode 2 and will be out in July, 2013. The game, which will take place in New Washington, Washington (a new game world), will be fully playable on the Xbox 360 backward compatible with the DS.
"Half-Life 2 Episode Two is the sequel to the most amazing and complex achievement in the series: completing Half-Life: Blue then saving every single one of the most dangerous and mysterious puzzles in the game," explains Lead Designer Bruce "F**k it" Murray, who was involved in the development of Half-Life 2 Episode 2. "In Half-Life 3 Episode 2, the story begins in New Quarantine, a community hospital on Earth - but now it is an abandoned underground facility, housing the dangerous Half-Life weapons and technology. Fortunately for anyone brave enough to survive its horrors, there is a young girl named Alyx who has found the cure to Half-Life 2: Episode 2's super-soldier virus. And as Alyx battles the undead hordes on the open streets of New Quarantine, the only way to save her is to go undercover as a doctor carrying a secret gun."
The developers hope "Half-Life: Episode 2" will introduce fans to much more of Seattle's incredible landscape.
"We're looking forward to seeing the scene where Alyx arrives and begins to explore these amazing new areas, like the creepy train station, old houses and warehouses that make you feel like you were back in the old times of the CDC," replied Murray.
"The newest part of playing Half-Life 3 Episode 2 is the new map Red Alert 3. The Red Alert map is based on the Chernobyl map from the original game. In this new map, Alyx must defend her freedom against waves of undead terrorists. It's up to the player to pilot a robot or find an EMP grenade to destroy these enemies."
"We are also working with publisher Warner Games on a Half-Life 3 sequel," explains CEO Gabe Newell. "We're a team of passionate people working closely with our talented writers, engineers and artists on a project that we think will wow gamers and entertain everyone at home."
"In our next project, the team is looking forward to seeing Half-Life 3 Episode 2 release at a critical mass," shared Newell, "We look forward to an amazing new adventure for everyone!"
Half-Life 3 Episode 2 is currently available to pre-order on the steam marketplace Steam for 699.99 bucks, on CD

======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
: Episode 3 for PlayStation (PC) and Xbox (PS3) this month.
First, let's go over what's different to Episode 3 like its predecessor - which has now been out for seven years. Episode 3 is darker than its predecessor through a choice of atmospheric, atmospheric lighting, enhanced environments, and dramatic cinematic sets. In particular, the environment itself has been fully recreated, with special attention to character detail, weather, lighting, and every detail of environment, texture, sound.
Here's a rundown on seven important things you'll notice that your group doesn't see today - the atmosphere, characters, environments, and the cinematics.
7. Character Visuals
"Half-Life has always been a fantasy world and Valve has always had that."
What are new? Character models; more detail.
"Half-Life has always been a fantasy world and Valve has always had that."
What are old? Visual quality with improved lighting.
"Half-Life has always been a fantasy world and Valve has always had that."
What can you expect? New environments - notably a better sky, a fuller and more populated atmosphere, and more plants.
8. The More New, The Better
New environments, lighting, and characters are important. They are the backbone to Episode 3's character and world. But by making more important of the "New" in the title of Episode 3, Valve are hoping to make Episode 3 a better, more dramatic game—and in doing that, the game's narrative as well.
"In previous games, you would see people dying and dying, we are making that more interesting," said Gabe Newell. "We wanted to show you these people [that are] walking [through] the Portal, you have been walking for many years, and to even do that in some light, make it hard for you to move? Well if we can make life more intense, make you do things within Portal with your time-limit, the game feels more alive too."
Those "time-limiting" sections of Portal could change the way you explore the game; imagine taking an active role in the game; interacting with the enemies and making it easier to travel through.
And there's more. "We want to keep that part of the game," said CFO Larry Probst. "It's already there, you've been sitting in a chair in a Valve studio, we know what you like, and we want to keep making you care about our product
======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
: Episode 3, which looks impressive. It also isn't as beautiful as Half-Life 2: Episode 1. Still, this third half-life will be "a whole lot of games," according to Rockstar CEO Gabe Newell, and it's got a new soundtrack. "The world's gone mad with music!" he said.
You can now pre-order Half-Life 3 on PC with the Steam Key. It's $20 (not discount) plus $20 in sales tax and $10 shipped to your current E3 and PSN addresses.
Get that if you, like me, can't get enough of Half-Life 2 HD remakes. Watch this space. You'll want to buy that. You'll also want to buy Half-Life 3 as the PC version is just $20, plus $20 shipping, which is also less than the $30 retail Xbox 360 or PS3 versions.

Author: Michael McWhertor
<image_or_gif>
Not surprisingly, the Street Fighter IV code leaked over the weekend. That does not, and shouldn't, imply anything other than EA's intent.
Those who look at the code for Street Fighter IV at the SourceFighter site, or at the latest patch notes for Street Fighter IV (1.01 release, which added more mechanics for players) will also notice three new character names and three unique characters from the Street Fighter IV roster.
Those names are Mike, Randy and Brian, as indicated in the pictures above. Both Mike and Randy are playable characters. Mike is not a playable character; Randy and Brian are characters that you can select to fight. Mike is available until December 14. Randy and Brian are available until December 21. (For reference, I picked up Street Fighter IV and a couple different characters on December 11 – Randy had a limited time code and me was waiting to see if I got him on September 10 or a little later. I picked up Randy on December 03, then Brian on December 04.)

 in the west, not the east. They will be coming here eventually, and will definitely bring it.
I hate to come off like an antagonistic person, but if they wanted to make the Half-Life series as unique as they could, they would have. They would spend money on an old-fashioned, sci-fi adventure game, with a cast of characters none of us know, and lots of it. They'd make Half-Life a lot like Myst , with its deep lore and big-sounding sci-fi stuff. Half-Life 2 was more like Tron: Wind Cave than there are now to identify more complex series with the most simplistic idea of what a game could be.
Let us remember that, before we get turned off by the name.

Since its launch in 2004, Half-Life® has proven to be a divisive title in the gaming industry. Despite critics who say it is a pretentious step up in complexity when compared to the first year's entry, many consider it to be one of the best and most recognizable video games ever made thanks largely to its memorable set pieces, unique characters, and excellent presentation.
Its iconic setting and iconic plot, which began development in 1998, have also been criticized due to those elements, and to its subsequent, largely unmitigated failures that included other studios refusing to commit, while detractors have argued parts of the work lack originality or are unnecessarily derivative.
It has been considered one of the most divisive games in the game industry, and its popularity is still felt by those who played it years ago, with many still playing on a relatively primitive 2D screen with an unreliable memory chip. [Source: Gamasutra]

======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================
 for Wii U! To celebrate the occasion, Valve's Rich Hickey and Team Fortress 3's Braden Lamb have come up with a new game in Half-Life 3, called The Penance.
As you can see in the trailer above (in which you can get a better look at The Penance with these screenshots), the game has its own menu and controls, but also is more than just an addition to the game. Hickey talked about the creative direction Valve gave to The Penance in terms of the main mechanics.
"Mostly it's about the combat. It's about our exploration and the tactical combat and the way it's got both sides attacking each other. They're dealing with new enemies," Hickey said. "As you explore you kill these new enemies to earn experience and to level up. A lot of all that, of course, is tied to maps and how we allow you to set up your base. 
"After a while you're starting to come across these great locations and you start to get a sense of where you're going. But overall, for us we were trying to think about the story and the characters of The Penance. So we wanted to create something like The Void that was a kind of journey that allowed you to go along with what you're doing. 
"It wasn't just for everybody to get the keys," Hickey continued. "It was for everyone to explore. We wanted to give them an option to do that."
The Penance is due out November 27 at PC and Xbox One, so if you don't get a chance to try it out in person, you can check out the new trailer here.

<|endoftext|>Final Fantasy XI Might Be Just As Challenging As That
Author: Stephen Totilo
<image_or_gif>
One of the things that makes the upcoming Final Fantasy XI stand apart from other MMOs is the fact that you can play it either as one kind of character, or the other. In most MMOs you can play as a man or a woman, or a neutral and a devil, or a devil and...something. This MMO is different, and it's exciting. And, yes, it's incredibly challenging at some of the higher levels (the player was able to slay multiple giant daemons in a single run!)
The battle system in this game—the way you move your characters around—is more of a result of the direction than of the ideas at hand. It'll be interesting to see how players respond to the system they find interesting, both when trying to get it to work with their existing skills but also when trying to master it.
<image_or_gif>
 The battle in Final Fantasy XI—the one that actually made me a believer—wasn't difficult, as the AI was amazingly smart as usual. I found that by taking a quick peek (hopefully it was just a fancy cursor), you could spot their red eyes, their light up blue gloves, and even some blue spots on their bodies. The ones where their tentacles were visible.
Those eyes were definitely looking at me. Even as I looked around, I could see those eyes slowly fade to black. You could tell that they were not looking at me, much less me at them. So it took some time after they took their final turn to notice that I wasn't there. That's when some action took place, in a world where it was really easy to notice the player's eye that was never there in the first place.

 The player of this game had to find

 and Half-Life 2: Episode 3, as well as the addition of two new Co-Op Missions, adding to the varied cast of playable characters.
The new missions line up with both versions of Team Fortress, delivering an intriguing new weapon and new missions for players who previously had no desire to venture out into the world and delve into an arena packed with hostile AI.
After the jump, take a look at Half-Life 2 missions! (And remember, your progress toward the end of the first Half-Life game will carry over to Half-Life 3.)

Here are the new missions:

All of this information would easily make you a shill, but the truth is, you'll want to read this anyway.
"To avoid being shut down, Half-Life 1 or Half-Life 2 must be copied and pasted into Half-Life 3," Valve wrote, "or its creators would have had no right to host it."
While developers such as Valve's Gabe Newell are capable of releasing their own games to the public, it's far from their responsibility. There are plenty of other third-party developers who need to build their own levels and, at this point, that's what needs to happen with Half-Life 3. Half-Life 2 was created by Portal 2's team - their original team - and Half-Life is by far their most important project, even if it's been almost eight years since Half-Life 2 was made.

<image_or_gif>

That's why everyone involved needs to look at the larger picture. To build a great game. A proper Half-Life game. They don't have to create an entirely new game, they just need to make one that's worthy of Half-Life and Half-Life 2: Episode 3.

There's a reason why Valve originally ran the Source engine. The tools for development. The tools for the game. It's easier to create, faster to create and it enables developers to push their game hard.

But why would Valve want Source? Especially at this late date?

"Well, in late 1999 and early 2000, the Source engine was becoming increasingly popular and becoming part of the trend that games were being built around it," Valve writes. "So it made sense for us to adopt the engine for Half-Life 3

, games they do not own, and will retain them. But in a world where every new thing comes from the creator of the original, and must be a violation, it will take almost two hours for a player to get everything they need to master Half-Life or any game from that franchise.
GameSpot: Is it possible to get the series free from Valve now that Half-Life is theirs?
Hachima Kikou: Part of all of us is taking risks, and I'm sure that not every game for the console has been an instant success. Games like Metal Gear Solid and Braid have had hundreds of thousands of dollars invested by hardcore gamers. The studio has spent millions on a game where the main characters are really cut-outs who look like you. Every time we try something new, we need to play it through from beginning to end to make sure things work. This isn't about a few million dollars and being able to go into game development on your own—it's about doing it on your own and letting other people try things from their own experiences.
​
GameSpot: When people do say they're doing things the old-fashioned way—simply talking about going to a video store for the cartridge to play a game of Portal 2 game—Are you trying to hide what you've built from Valve?
Hachima Kikou: I have no intentions of hiding what we're working on—what we're making and making fun of won't hurt them any. We're not showing their crap. It's about demonstrating what happens when we go outside of the box.
​
GameSpot: Some people will say it's game dev that's been under a rock. That that may be it. That we're in the know.
Hachima Kikou: We're not on any big gaming platforms. There are some important things we want to make, but we're going to do it on our own. It won't be done out of Valve's box. There will be a lot more coming from fans in 2014. I'm a gamer myself. Looking back, I would also say that the people who have been most vocal on this platform issue have obviously bought into being very vocal about this whole thing. This isn't my big issue, but it was a game-changing issue here for me. It brought me into that realm.

GameSpot: Back in '97-'98, EA was making Call of Duty. Somehow it is taking on Half-Life
======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
 since the Xbox 360
Funnily enough, back in 2011, Nintendo gave us their exclusive rights on a game of their Half-Life series. Back when the Xbox 360, which had a much more complex multiplayer feature, was even released, I took a look at the Left 4 Dead campaign (which is available for $9.99 now, and which I consider a good example of what I was going to write about this year):
And here are the rights here:
At that time, I assumed that Half-Life 2 had the rights to Half-Life 3 as well. I actually was somewhat surprised that, but I now know that it didn't. Because the deal was finalized in a meeting in Tokyo.

Remember how the gaming world has changed since the deal was signed with Microsoft? Back then, I looked at Half-Life 1: Episode One, and here is what I wrote back then:
Here is what I wrote again in 2014:
And here is what I wrote again in 2016:
This deal, along with the original Halo and Portal games, makes Half-Life 2 the best-looking game of last year. For all we know, Microsoft really wants to lock in Half-Life 2. They could just change the deal and put it to Sony and let Sony make Half-Life 2 and the next entry into the series. Maybe they just decided that.
Halo and Portal 2 had the same deal, and they were both very different games. Like the first Half-Life, Halo had a huge story. Portal had one.
I couldn't keep up. I couldn't keep up.
And honestly, I don't think we can.
I've given a lot of thought to the issue of multi-million dollar publishers wanting more control. Take, for example, Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, which has a multi-millions-of-dollars budget. Their publisher, Naughty Dog, decided to change a deal they had with Microsoft to give the producer a certain amount of money based on how much it is in revenue for one year, for example.
Naughty Dog felt it needed a little more money to be able to make the Uncharted series. At this point, however, the first video games, which are the most successful, tend to be multi-million dollar franchises. So they decided to simply put $1 billion on the table and tell Sega, a company that really might have wanted something like Uncharted, that they would allow SEGA to make

To date, Half-Life 2: Episode One game has been priced at about $60. It was set for releasing in mid-1990 for the NES and has since sold more than 85 million copies - more than 70 years after its release.

<|endoftext|>There's Something About That Cute Mummy From Nintendo's Mario Maker: An Awkwardly Unimpressive Game
Author: Brian Crecente
<image_or_gif>
 We know by now that Mario Maker is coming to Wii U and 3DS this winter, much like Nintendo is coming out with Wii Fit, Wii Zone, Animal Crossing and Street Fighter. Now we know that it will also have anthropomorphized panda characters. So at the tail end of this month we get the game we knew most about but felt was the weakest in its genre: a cutely anthropomorphic mummy.
The adorable little mummy is a plush mama's doll from Animal Crossing that's dressed the same as the main character. The idea makes a lot of more than cute; it's one of the most anticipated games of the year.
Unlike Mario Maker it's a touch-based game, a more traditional Animal Crossing approach to making things. You'll be able to make stuffed animals just like your moms while wearing the outfits of their children. Which you should do.
It's a cute-as-hell way to get your holiday spirit, but what we didn't know is that it's an all-ages game. Play it in an area where children will be gaming. Which gives off the impression that it'll serve as a fun platform to explore other ways for you. Don't play multiplayer on your mobile device, though, lest it play catch-up with your kids while they're sleeping right next to you.
It'll be released on the Wii U console later this year and on 3DS later this year.

======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================

With the announcement just in the last two months of 2012, it wouldn't be a surprise if one of Nintendo's most highly regarded franchises were getting a PlayStation 3 remake. If nothing, Sony has been reported to be looking to make a new Half-Life game, with director Gordon Freeman being the biggest name that it's said to be considering. There's the possibility there could also be some elements from Xbox Live Arcade's Alien vs Predator or Gears of War 2, but that is very much speculation at this point.
If PS3's Half-Life were to be released on the PlayStation for the first time, that would have to be as good as it gets, right?
...it would be amazing! However, that's no guarantee. As I mentioned already in this column, things could blow up in Super Mario Land and Super Mario Advance 4 in the coming years, both of which are considered fantastic. Yes, a remake is great, but that doesn't mean it would be good by itself.
To that end, I did some quick looking at some historical sources on the history of the world, and things you might see as impossible and unthinkable that never happen. While you're at it, here are things that could happen:
Rise of Video Game Theories
If it were to happen, it would have to be some time after 2004. So while people still see the game as existing, you can guess that it most certainly won't be finished in 3 years.
What if the game didn't happen or is delayed? The current age of first-person shooters is largely due to people demanding more that guns and jumping. Something could happen to the business model or license to make the game a PS3 exclusivity game.
Maybe the developer isn't interested in doing the game anyway? Maybe they do want to make the PS3 version of a computer game, but only if they can sell more of it at retail for under two dollars. Maybe that is the way games are made, however. We still don't know.
Why would publishers make a new game from a franchise that is now 40 years old?
What would it change about the game - would it make it more complicated? More challenging? Things could go wrong then or even right after release, depending on how well development could work. The game could get in the way of development or even become a waste of time and money that could be used to launch PS3 versions of other games based on older franchises.

With these guys behind. In March, the company announced they had purchased out those Half-Life universe rights owned by Valve. No game development required. Except...
Just to make sure you guys know that, that's not all. The company will be collaborating with developers on upcoming projects.
They said they'd be adding support to future Half-Life games and have plans to expand into games that were already in development for other platforms.
Well... what else? We're sure we missed at least some of these. Oh, well, we still think that's awesome!
Valve has acquired global rights to Middle-Earth, in order to form a new "team" and create new IPs. It sounds like they are looking into movies in the future of Middle-Earth as well. No word on license timing yet. They also said they'd be announcing more details about this soon.

 and the new Final Fantasy in general in order to develop The Division, says the studio.
"We wanted to develop the next big thing we wanted to build, and that's what we did—we're building it in The Division."
So is this the beginning of a more serious partnership with Valve or the end of the company? Maybe neither, as the studio is still searching for the right formula for Half-Life game, which is considered the first true virtual reality game.
The Division is already the most hyped video game of 2012, having received a huge amount of press coverage already, plus the game has been awarded three new "Best" awards from various outlets.
According to VG247 there were 3,000,000 registered users (including the beta version for the game) when the game launch.
The developer on new Half-Life game "To Develop, We Need The Division":
"We already have two games that we've really been developing and I believe we have two more in the game, so we have a lot of more work in front of us. We want to make The Division and The Division, like we'd make a video game, [and develop that] and make a game with the same ideas. That's where this company comes in in a big way, it's kind of the next generation of gaming and the current generation of gaming. The Division is the next next major thing that I think is set to develop, hopefully in the coming years."
"We're really excited and very excited to work in The Division."

The Division is due for release in 2014 for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360. For more information, check out VG247's report.

Author: Owen Good
<image_or_gif>
The best video game I ever played is the very best that ever existed.
So I'll tell you what else I had for lunch.
It must have taken the "Star Wars" craze to hit me at the same time. I was a complete stranger to the iconic video game franchise and nothing like it had ever appeared in video games.
<image_or_gif>
The best video game of the 20th century, of the 20 year past.
The very best that ever existed.
It must have seemed impossible.
That's because it was not for me. Not yet at all.
I don't love game-based experiences. I love my kids, my friends, my cat. Anything better than a big old game console beating on a table is awesome.
But watching the two men I have in the video below tackle Diablo III was the heart and soul of the video game experience I just finished.
He is not only a champion of video gaming, he's a pioneer, innovator, and also a legend.

Called by Blizzard as "the best video game ever made, at almost any price and with virtually any appearance," "Masters of War" is a story in video and video game form, perhaps the story of video gaming.
It is, perhaps, the story of video game creation.

Benedict Cumberbatch did not get the credits for "Diablo III." But that didn't prevent him from being the inspiration for one of the greatest heroes of all time.
He got the credits for "Diablo III: Reaper of Souls," which would have been the opening credits if his character had played, and for "BioShock," although his character didn''t play the game. Which made him at the very least the inspiration for "The Last of Us," for at least two different games

Nintendo has another Nintendo title, the highly anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles, coming this fall. For all we know, that game will be worth buying, but in all candor, here's Nintendo's approach on the games Nintendo has already committed to showing a generation. "So many games out there and games have already been shown at E3. It's too convoluted . So it is what it is," writes one fan (not me, not a fan, not a writer) at an E3 fan site.
Nintendo, if you have a show that doesn't live up to the hype, or even the official game description, you're not doing well. If you do however, at least let our staff know. If we miss our stride and stumble with what is a genuinely interesting new IP, let us know.<|endoftext|>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prime Minister Tony Abbott: "We will not let an innocent child into this world."

The prime minister said innocent life was at stake when he spoke to a dying baby girl trapped in a life-threatening oxygen tank.

Tim Hunt, 43, had to operate and push his four-week-old daughter Dawn until the oxygen was turned off.

He said an innocent child was at risk.

"The prime minister tells us that if the State (has this) in their system, the child is innocent, the boy is innocent," he told ABC Radio Melbourne's Scott Alexander, referring to the alleged child rape and murder of a baby girl in Queensland.

"The prime minister tells us that a child could be innocent until proven guilty, and that child still is innocent until proven guilty."

Mr Hunt, who is also a barrister, said he had been able to get an apology from the Commonwealth of Australia.

He also told Mr Alexander that he, and his family had nothing to hide.

"We asked for not to be involved in the child being in the oxygen tube, and to

' Portal, which the company has since bought.
Gatiss also told Kotaku that it is a long and hard road.
"What I would like would be for Valve and Microsoft to just acknowledge the fact that we've made a huge error and to move on," he said. "That would be the first thing I would need Microsoft to do."
This comes just one day after EA confirmed that it plans to launch an esports sports team with the help of Valve. Valve is currently working with Team Liquid, a team created by pro gamer Dennis "Notch" Persson to compete in the competitive video game League of Legends.

Author: Jason Schreier
On Wednesday I played my first copy of Ubisoft's epic, super-genre-defining Assassin's Creed, which may not have been a particularly satisfying experience—but was absolutely worth it.   After it was finished, I played it a couple more times without much of a problem. I could not stop gipping, hugging friends and waiting for the other player to finish and I didn't mind at all. I was even able to play three other Assassin's Creed games—all of which were okay, but by no means stellar—in one sitting. 
The Assassin's Creed: Origins was still being worked on today.
I've only played as an assassin since I was 12 or so. Only because I kept finding a way to make a guy stand still go for the kill. So I played Assassin's Creed 2: The Darkside, because I liked the way the game's first playtest partner—Sam Fisher—played, but didn't have the skill sets to be a real Assassin. I played for hours in that game, playing through a pre-rendered film-like story of the four characters, and then every time I finished I was introduced to my new guy/girl—this was all just for a quick demo. (No, I don't know what my character looked like in my first Assassin's Creed video: You can see an image of me from my time I played it here. I looked like a pudgy guy with glasses who looked like he could have just woken up and gone into your face from a mile away. The guy in the picture is my first partner in actual combat, so that was just my first Assassin's Creed video.)

 and Left 4 Dead. Seems like an awfully broad license for the Wii.
Here's the full statement from Nintendo:
"Thanks to Sam and Linda's generosity and the input of the Left 4 Dead team, we have acquired rights to a popular video game franchise and have acquired the rights to other popular video game franchises. These additional titles will continue to include exclusive content such as original level design, iconic character designs and interactive features on Wii Remote and Wii U GamePad. For the next year we will also be producing new and exclusive features and content based on and inspired by our current franchises, including the Left 4 Dead series. Until the new titles are completed in 2012 Nintendo of America will continue to produce Left 4 Dead for Wii and will begin production of Half-Life 3."
Nintendo doesn't have a new IP yet, though the company has also said that even that is pretty broad, and given the license to Half-Life it will probably be possible. But it adds that it will, in the future, continue to publish other video game franchises based on other franchises.
Here's Valve announcing that Half-Life 2 worked out like this:
"To improve the quality of the game and to make it easier to tell the story of the movie, Valve created Valveworks and added a special edition box, designed to take extra time out from the movie's production. The movie's director, Francis Ford Coppola, was on our team and his knowledge and enthusiasm came across in the specially designed Valveworks box. He was also impressed by our team's technical abilities in keeping the entire computer cool with constant use and the ability to handle thousands of packets."
Here's a more detailed statement, this time from Portal fame :
"The Left 4 Dead team spent weeks making their new game and in the process came up with many new unique and innovative solutions for the game. In 2002, we started working on the Left 4 Dead project under the name Portal: Left 4 Dead. We knew from previous Left 4 Dead work that we were going to have a different perspective on the gameplay. This time we were able to combine the same old elements of survival and death-game gameplay and we built Left 4 Dead to remain true to the source material.
We started with some great level design concepts such as the 'hustle' and the 'rush'. I really enjoyed working with the Left 4 Dead team, especially playing it on the Wii. The experience was truly inspirational to me since it was not only a product of the Left 4 Dead vision
