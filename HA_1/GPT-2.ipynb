One of the coolest new things that I've found so far in my travels in Cyrodiil, has been spotting the new and improved mobs that appear in our first few hundred hours. These are the kind of mobs that were a staple in early releases of this game (it wasn't until I played through The Awakening that I started to get them). For instance, after the introduction of two new major mobs (Nemesis and Vampire) in the first two maps that were available in the DLC, this new data is used to predict the kind of monsters we're likely to find—as well as what kind of mob we're likely to fight in the final mission.\n","The new monsters are much more powerful than their predecessors, though. Since The Awakening, players have seen monsters like a Blood Mage, a Dragonborn, and even a Demon Lord. With The Black Marsh, new bosses (the Nightmare Reaper and The Scoundrel ) were added, and in The Awakening, we got to see new bosses, which is great.\n","What I did not expect was that this new information can also be used to predict how strong the bosses will be in the game. As previously mentioned in the introduction to the game, The Black Marsh introduced the most powerful new boss on the server, but we didn't expect him to be so powerful as to completely shatter our confidence. That was the case with the Nightmare Reaper, where it was revealed that the Reaper could summon \"ghosts\" to strike at our hero. With this data to help us guess what kind of monster is going to attack him and the data given to determine his strength, we can now predict the new bosses' strength better than ever.\n","I've been impressed to see how quickly The Black Marsh has evolved, thanks to players like you. The Black Marsh is now one of the most challenging content packs available in the game, and I am looking forward to finding out which map or map part of the pack is the most challenging as I head into the game. I know what you want to know, though. Are new bosses stronger than ever? Are new bosses stronger than the ones in the first few hundred hours of this game? Do you think this data can be used for new quests?\n","How to Play with the Data\n","What players should not know about this data is that it doesn't allow you to pick your heroes, but you will be able to choose which hero you want to control. To tell your story in the game, I would recommend selecting two heroes over two different champions. Instead of choosing one hero and one champion, you'll select both heroes and one champion. This ensures that you will have a variety of heroes to choose from in the game. If you're playing a mage hero, I would recommend picking a mage as your main character.\n","If you want a healer, I would recommend the healer hero. The data tells you, as it usually does in the game, that a healer will be the most powerful hero. I picked the healer heroes because I felt that they were the hero I needed most and that they were also the hero to play for the most. When the Black Marsh's new champions were released, The Black Marsh's healer heroes were much more powerful than they had been before.\n","We also can use this information to see how the game is playing. Do you have the Black Marsh? Are you very lucky or very unlucky? This new data can actually tell you! And if you've played this game enough, you'll have played over two hundred hours. If you've played this game enough, you'll have played two hundred hours.

You'll find yourself in some of the world's most beautiful locations--you'll have to explore caves and subterranean areas that only exist in a game. The world, in fact, has some unique creatures and creatures who, thanks to you, can have a fair fight with. The game also has a variety of quests like catching all the fish of the world, finding some rare drops, defeating bosses, and so much more. I'd also say that it's a lot of fun to go fishing, to get your gear back, and then hunt the rare fish of the world for the new ones.\n","When it comes to the multiplayer aspect of the game, I can say there will be lots of matches to play. Each player has a certain number of players in their party, and there'll be random encounters to engage them in during battle. I did not enjoy the single-player portion of the game, but the multiplayer aspect of this game is really nice.\n","A good looking, interesting setting. One thing not mentioned by me, however, is how to actually make the game look amazing.\n","The world is beautiful with an impressive amount of detail, and it also looks like a lot of effort was put into that. The game has a good amount of detail thanks to this. The world looks as though it was meant to look. You'll find the landscape of the world, the water of the ocean, and the trees. Some of the monsters look great as well, such as the monster of an octopus monster in the back of the cave.\n","The graphics look great in the world of The Lost Valley, and there's also an atmosphere of a fantasy game you'll never get tired of. There's also a lot of music and various music elements scattered throughout the game. There are also some puzzles, which you'll have to solve if you want to progress the story. There is a bit of magic thrown in the game, so this might have been a good way for you to discover some of the spells.\n","The game is definitely not for the faint-hearted. I had a ton of fun with it, but there is a little too much of a story and not enough of a story to keep me interested over the course of the entire game. However, it's good in the world of The Lost Valley and the setting of The Lost Valley. It definitely is worth a play.\n","This review was updated on March 17 to include the game's first trailer. Reviewed on the PlayStation 3.\n","Don't let the bad looking graphics fool you though! The world looks very much like the world of Guild Wars and is a great place to go exploring in the world of The Lost Valley if you play it at the time. The animation and artwork look fantastic and gives the world of The Lost Valley a fantastical look.\n","I didn't have time to play the demo, but you can grab the game at the official website for more details.\n","[Source]\n","You are logged out.

I'll be back with my next installment in the series in a little bit, but for now we'll head to the other end of Comic Con and the Marvel booth, one of the three big ones in San Diego. If you've been here before, you already know about the Giant Robot, but if you haven't, be sure to read our previous story.\n","It's a weird feeling to know that Marvel are planning to make a giant robot like in The Avengers, the same guy who built the one that appeared in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Sure, we can assume that this is going to be a huge hit with fans of the Marvel universe, since they have been building such an amazing machine since its creation almost two years ago. But what do they actually make of it? Will it prove to be an important part of their future and what they can do with it to help them expand their universe?\n","I have to say, I'm not really sure how this will end up. A very large robot. That's kind of the end of the story from the point of view of the robot as a character, but we don't know the outcome of this story so it could still happen. Or, there's still a chance this might lead to a bigger, better big robot. But in this panel, they are talking about how the robot is now part of their team, it's just a smaller version because of time.\n","[gallery ids=\"13051,13052,13053\"]\n","While the giant robot,\n","\n","[1200 | 341.44] loss=1.87 avg=2.80\n","[1201 | 343.02] loss=3.30 avg=2.80\n","[1202 | 344.61] loss=2.57 avg=2.80\n","[1203 | 346.20] loss=2.78 avg=2.80\n","[1204 | 347.78] loss=2.45 avg=2.80\n","[1205 | 349.35] loss=3.04 avg=2.80\n","[1206 | 350.93] loss=3.19 avg=2.80\n","[1207 | 352.51] loss=3.12 avg=2.81\n","[1208 | 354.10] loss=1.27 avg=2.79\n","[1209 | 355.68] loss=2.70 avg=2.79\n","[1210 | 357.26] loss=3.19 avg=2.79\n","[1211 | 358.85] loss=2.83 avg=2.79\n","[1212 | 360.43] loss=2.62 avg=2.79\n","[1213 | 362.01] loss=2.14 avg=2.78\n","[1214 | 363.59] loss=1.62 avg=2.77\n","[1215 | 365.18] loss=3.61 avg=2.78\n","[1216 | 366.76] loss=2.80 avg=2.78\n","[1217 | 368.35] loss=2.81 avg=2.78\n","[1218 | 369.94] loss=2.28 avg=2.78\n","[1219 | 371.51] loss=2.38 avg=2.77\n","[1220 | 373.10] loss=2.99 avg=2.77\n","[1221 | 374.69] loss=3.20 avg=2.78\n","[1222 | 376.28] loss=2.44 avg=2.77\n","[1223 | 377.87] loss=3.10 avg=2.78\n","[1224 | 379.46] loss=2.65 avg=2.78\n","[1225 | 381.05] loss=2.74 avg=2.78\n","[1226 | 382.64] loss=2.74 avg=2.78\n","[1227 | 384.23] loss=2.53 avg=2.77\n","[1228 | 385.81] loss=2.56 avg=2.77\n","[1229 | 387.41] loss=2.66 avg=2.77\n","[1230 | 388.99] loss=1.32 avg=2.75\n","[1231 | 390.58] loss=2.49 avg=2.75\n","[1232 | 392.16] loss=2.99 avg=2.75\n","[1233 | 393.76] loss=2.92 avg=2.75\n","[1234 | 395.34] loss=2.75 avg=2.75\n","[1235 | 396.92] loss=2.14 avg=2.75\n","[1236 | 398.51] loss=3.06 avg=2.75\n","[1237 | 400.10] loss=2.60 avg=2.75\n","[1238 | 401.69] loss=3.05 avg=2.75\n","[1239 | 403.28] loss=2.66 avg=2.75\n","[1240 | 404.87] loss=3.00 avg=2.75\n","[1241 | 406.47] loss=2.51 avg=2.75\n","[1242 | 408.06] loss=2.67 avg=2.75\n","[1243 | 409.65] loss=2.94 avg=2.75\n","[1244 | 411.24] loss=3.02 avg=2.76\n","[1245 | 412.83] loss=2.91 avg=2.76\n","[1246 | 414.42] loss=3.43 avg=2.77\n","[1247 | 416.01] loss=2.79 avg=2.77\n","[1248 | 417.61] loss=3.06 avg=2.77\n","[1249 | 419.20] loss=2.81 avg=2.77\n","[1250 | 420.78] loss=2.85 avg=2.77\n","[1251 | 422.36] loss=3.15 avg=2.77\n","[1252 | 423.95] loss=2.71 avg=2.77\n","[1253 | 425.54] loss=2.72 avg=2.77\n","[1254 | 427.12] loss=3.05 avg=2.78\n","[1255 | 428.70] loss=2.92 avg=2.78\n","[1256 | 430.29] loss=3.12 avg=2.78\n","[1257 | 431.88] loss=2.89 avg=2.78\n","[1258 | 433.46] loss=3.20 avg=2.79\n","[1259 | 435.05] loss=2.93 avg=2.79\n","[1260 | 436.64] loss=3.12 avg=2.79\n","[1261 | 438.23] loss=2.85 avg=2.79\n","[1262 | 439.82] loss=2.96 avg=2.80\n","[1263 | 441.41] loss=2.11 avg=2.79\n","[1264 | 442.99] loss=2.77 avg=2.79\n","[1265 | 444.57] loss=2.79 avg=2.79\n","[1266 | 446.16] loss=2.54 avg=2.78\n","[1267 | 447.75] loss=2.89 avg=2.79\n","[1268 | 449.34] loss=2.92 avg=2.79\n","[1269 | 450.93] loss=2.31 avg=2.78\n","[1270 | 452.50] loss=2.83 avg=2.78\n","[1271 | 454.09] loss=2.71 avg=2.78\n","[1272 | 455.68] loss=2.84 avg=2.78\n","[1273 | 457.27] loss=2.88 avg=2.78\n","[1274 | 458.86] loss=3.01 avg=2.79\n","[1275 | 460.45] loss=3.06 avg=2.79\n","[1276 | 462.04] loss=2.45 avg=2.79\n","[1277 | 463.63] loss=2.10 avg=2.78\n","[1278 | 465.22] loss=2.86 avg=2.78\n","[1279 | 466.81] loss=2.95 avg=2.78\n","[1280 | 468.40] loss=2.54 avg=2.78\n","[1281 | 469.99] loss=2.63 avg=2.78\n","[1282 | 471.58] loss=2.92 avg=2.78\n","[1283 | 473.17] loss=2.84 avg=2.78\n","[1284 | 474.75] loss=2.74 avg=2.78\n","[1285 | 476.33] loss=3.15 avg=2.78\n","[1286 | 477.93] loss=2.39 avg=2.78\n","[1287 | 479.51] loss=3.10 avg=2.78\n","[1288 | 481.10] loss=3.03 avg=2.78\n","[1289 | 482.69] loss=3.02 avg=2.79\n","[1290 | 484.28] loss=3.25 avg=2.79\n","[1291 | 485.87] loss=3.45 avg=2.80\n","[1292 | 487.46] loss=2.77 avg=2.80\n","[1293 | 489.04] loss=3.03 avg=2.80\n","[1294 | 490.63] loss=2.88 avg=2.80\n","[1295 | 492.22] loss=2.71 avg=2.80\n","[1296 | 493.80] loss=2.61 avg=2.80\n","[1297 | 495.39] loss=2.77 avg=2.80\n","[1298 | 496.98] loss=2.92 avg=2.80\n","[1299 | 498.56] loss=2.75 avg=2.80\n","Generating samples...\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n"," if, by all accounts, he is one of the worst leaders the US could have.

It isn't just a simple tool for sharing audio, it is also a huge force for sharing music, a force for creating (or, less commonly, reproducing) video games, a force for teaching us about our bodies in new ways, and many other exciting, sometimes absurd things.\n","There's even a powerful force that will never end—a force not only to facilitate and improve, but to inspire innovation in both the recording industry and in the world's economy.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","\n","The Internet's role as both a force to improve and transform the world of music and games isn't just the case as it is today. As the great writer and inventor Peter Thiel has written, \"The Internet is what happens when computers take over everything.\"\n","\"The Internet is what happens when computers take over everything\", to be precise. It's a force of nature.\n","<gif_or_video>\n","It also happened yesterday.\n","It took two days for Spotify's VP of Global Product Jim Johnson to make the case for using the Internet \"to reshape the playing field for artists and innovators\".

It just so happens that I've made it into a club just for the occasion, and by the power of that association one of these retro games has died.\n","Wipeout was released in Europe, where it was released on a Nintendo DS and not Sega's first Neo Geo handheld. Wipeout is a first-person, single-player action/comedy game set in a futuristic, post-nuclear wasteland that involves running, jumping and shooting your way through a series of mini-games and a variety of enemies. The concept seems to have been inspired by a few of the NES classics and some of Nintendo's more recent titles, but the game's most famous aspect stems from its title.\n","\"Wipeout\" was originally released in Japan in October 1990 (as the title implies), for the Neo Nintendo handheld released in Japan in December 1993. The game's popularity there led to Sega releasing it in the West a few months later, which has been widely distributed as a Japanese-only title among North American gaming fans over the last couple of days.\n","Today, we have the new Wipeout 3DS version, due to be released exclusively in the US. It has new and updated graphics and features such as a custom soundtrack and multiple endings.\n","While I am excited to finally play this new version of Wipeout in the wild, it also may be that I should also be.

A game not of this generation. It's like picking up a Nintendo 64 in your twenties; a console that you can't play any other way. What amazes me is how much time people spent building all this stuff to create a console to take them straight from the digital age. I wish I could go back and play on my Nintendo. \n","As I played more, I decided to go with PC. It's just the console in my heart. To play it for the first time I wanted to take the time to build that beautiful system, as a game as the series has. My first thoughts were the PC port. My second thoughts were PC.\n","What I found is that there is something different about this. When I play Resident Evil, it feels like a console game. That it is a game that is different in that it is not a direct port of the Resident Evil 1 and 2, a direct remake for this generation, but a completely new machine.\n","To do that, I needed to find a good old fashioned console and a copy of Resident Evil 1 and 2. A game I can get easily. The console would be hard to lose for a good reason. The PC is the best of both worlds. \n","The PC would take much more time to complete than the console. The console would not have to be built to order. I found a copy of a retail copy of Resident Evil for the PC, but when I had the chance, I chose to do a console version instead. I am not trying to be some kind of console evangelist. I am just trying a console game for my own personal tastes.\n","I know many of you who buy a PC and spend a great deal of their time in order to get around. I understand completely. There is so much more involved in making a console than what I did. But I do still get a bit disappointed when I leave the console in a hotel with my friends and they come to me about their feelings. I am not sorry for the disappointment but I did not expect it. I did not expect it because the console looks beautiful and beautiful it does. The console has a great amount of visual appeal that is just right. The console is beautiful so to have something beautiful, it just takes a lot of work to get right but when I had the chance to do so, it was easy to do.\n","When I do get down to it though, I find the console version of Resident Evil 2 to be a great game. The PC port feels like a console entry if you look at the style that was in that game and how it was created. I want to say that this game looks really nice, but I can only do a quick image comparison and I will not get into that more today. The comparison can be taken from this video.\n","As of posting, I have finished working on the PC version of Resident Evil 2. I have the console version and it looks great.\n","The next step in that adventure is my first attempt at trying one of these games on my own. My first choice of PC port of Resident Evil was Resident Evil 0: The Mercenaries Chronicles as the game type. It is a console game. As I have only worked on the PC version of Resident Evil 0, I went with it for this game. Again, I am not ready for a full on console version yet.\n","In the meantime, I am still trying to make it a console-like experience, with a great deal of work going on here and a good deal of time away. My first choice has been Resident Evil 2 HD. I am not sure if you can just tell people to build one. But if they can then I want to show you what happens when they build it. It has a great deal of the Resident Evil look and feel that my original PC port had, but that is only because it was built with PS2 controllers and the PC version was built for Xbox 360.\n","For now, I think that I have one final console version in this quest and it is on Steam.\n","I am really looking forward to the first time I play the game to see if it is worth going to the trouble of building that machine and then playing that game over and over until I get it to work well. \n","My first PC experience with Resident Evil was on a PlayStation 2. It was the first game I owned that was of an entry level style. I bought the PS2 on the back of a Sony retail product from Japan. I still have a PS2 in my house. I want to take it to the next level and play it on this console. I am hoping to build it and try it out.\n","It turns out the PC version of Resident Evil 2 is more of a sequel than anything else. I have taken it there but it is going to be a big step here. I would like to get it up to the next level\n","\n","[1900 | 1604.39] loss=2.50 avg=2.72\n","[1901 | 1605.98] loss=2.33 avg=2.72\n","[1902 | 1607.57] loss=2.81 avg=2.72\n","[1903 | 1609.16] loss=3.22 avg=2.72\n","[1904 | 1610.75] loss=3.03 avg=2.73\n","[1905 | 1612.34] loss=2.84 avg=2.73\n","[1906 | 1613.93] loss=2.71 avg=2.73\n","[1907 | 1615.51] loss=2.89 avg=2.73\n","[1908 | 1617.09] loss=2.79 avg=2.73\n","[1909 | 1618.68] loss=2.82 avg=2.73\n","[1910 | 1620.26] loss=2.94 avg=2.73\n","[1911 | 1621.85] loss=2.93 avg=2.73\n","[1912 | 1623.43] loss=2.89 avg=2.74\n","[1913 | 1625.01] loss=2.73 avg=2.74\n","[1914 | 1626.60] loss=2.82 avg=2.74\n","[1915 | 1628.18] loss=3.02 avg=2.74\n","[1916 | 1629.77] loss=2.50 avg=2.74\n","[1917 | 1631.35] loss=3.23 avg=2.74\n","[1918 | 1632.93] loss=2.89 avg=2.74\n","[1919 | 1634.52] loss=2.59 avg=2.74\n","[1920 | 1636.10] loss=2.68 avg=2.74\n","[1921 | 1637.68] loss=2.32 avg=2.74\n","[1922 | 1639.27] loss=2.51 avg=2.73\n","[1923 | 1640.85] loss=3.03 avg=2.74\n","[1924 | 1642.44] loss=2.90 avg=2.74\n","[1925 | 1644.03] loss=3.04 avg=2.74\n","[1926 | 1645.62] loss=3.05 avg=2.75\n","[1927 | 1647.22] loss=2.77 avg=2.75\n","[1928 | 1648.80] loss=2.23 avg=2.74\n","[1929 | 1650.39] loss=2.83 avg=2.74\n","[1930 | 1651.98] loss=3.15 avg=2.75\n","[1931 | 1653.57] loss=2.91 avg=2.75\n","[1932 | 1655.16] loss=3.36 avg=2.75\n","[1933 | 1656.75] loss=2.85 avg=2.75\n","[1934 | 1658.34] loss=2.82 avg=2.75\n","[1935 | 1659.92] loss=2.55 avg=2.75\n","[1936 | 1661.51] loss=2.46 avg=2.75\n","[1937 | 1663.10] loss=1.60 avg=2.74\n","[1938 | 1664.70] loss=3.24 avg=2.74\n","[1939 | 1666.28] loss=2.43 avg=2.74\n","[1940 | 1667.88] loss=2.82 avg=2.74\n","[1941 | 1669.46] loss=2.78 avg=2.74\n","[1942 | 1671.05] loss=2.87 avg=2.74\n","[1943 | 1672.64] loss=3.10 avg=2.75\n","[1944 | 1674.23] loss=2.43 avg=2.74\n","[1945 | 1675.81] loss=2.51 avg=2.74\n","[1946 | 1677.41] loss=2.92 avg=2.74\n","[1947 | 1679.00] loss=3.26 avg=2.75\n","[1948 | 1680.59] loss=2.88 avg=2.75\n","[1949 | 1682.19] loss=2.63 avg=2.75\n","[1950 | 1683.78] loss=2.54 avg=2.75\n","[1951 | 1685.37] loss=2.91 avg=2.75\n","[1952 | 1686.96] loss=2.63 avg=2.75\n","[1953 | 1688.55] loss=3.11 avg=2.75\n","[1954 | 1690.14] loss=1.70 avg=2.74\n","[1955 | 1691.72] loss=2.82 avg=2.74\n","[1956 | 1693.31] loss=2.55 avg=2.74\n","[1957 | 1694.90] loss=2.77 avg=2.74\n","[1958 | 1696.49] loss=2.32 avg=2.73\n","[1959 | 1698.08] loss=2.74 avg=2.73\n","[1960 | 1699.67] loss=2.60 avg=2.73\n","[1961 | 1701.26] loss=2.52 avg=2.73\n","[1962 | 1702.85] loss=3.30 avg=2.74\n","[1963 | 1704.44] loss=2.77 avg=2.74\n","[1964 | 1706.03] loss=2.89 avg=2.74\n","[1965 | 1707.61] loss=2.56 avg=2.74\n","[1966 | 1709.20] loss=3.05 avg=2.74\n","[1967 | 1710.78] loss=2.62 avg=2.74\n","[1968 | 1712.37] loss=2.69 avg=2.74\n","[1969 | 1713.96] loss=2.33 avg=2.73\n","[1970 | 1715.55] loss=2.84 avg=2.73\n","[1971 | 1717.14] loss=2.77 avg=2.74\n","[1972 | 1718.71] loss=2.51 avg=2.73\n","[1973 | 1720.28] loss=2.89 avg=2.73\n","[1974 | 1721.86] loss=3.12 avg=2.74\n","[1975 | 1723.45] loss=2.76 avg=2.74\n","[1976 | 1725.03] loss=2.64 avg=2.74\n","[1977 | 1726.60] loss=2.02 avg=2.73\n","[1978 | 1728.19] loss=2.90 avg=2.73\n","[1979 | 1729.77] loss=2.77 avg=2.73\n","[1980 | 1731.35] loss=2.30 avg=2.73\n","[1981 | 1732.95] loss=2.62 avg=2.73\n","[1982 | 1734.53] loss=2.56 avg=2.73\n","[1983 | 1736.12] loss=2.53 avg=2.72\n","[1984 | 1737.70] loss=2.81 avg=2.72\n","[1985 | 1739.29] loss=2.75 avg=2.72\n","[1986 | 1740.87] loss=2.54 avg=2.72\n","[1987 | 1742.46] loss=2.91 avg=2.72\n","[1988 | 1744.05] loss=2.96 avg=2.73\n","[1989 | 1745.64] loss=2.54 avg=2.73\n","[1990 | 1747.22] loss=2.57 avg=2.72\n","[1991 | 1748.80] loss=2.75 avg=2.72\n","[1992 | 1750.39] loss=2.81 avg=2.72\n","[1993 | 1751.98] loss=2.42 avg=2.72\n","[1994 | 1753.56] loss=2.95 avg=2.72\n","[1995 | 1755.15] loss=2.98 avg=2.73\n","[1996 | 1756.73] loss=2.76 avg=2.73\n","[1997 | 1758.32] loss=3.23 avg=2.73\n","[1998 | 1759.91] loss=2.72 avg=2.73\n","[1999 | 1761.49] loss=2.93 avg=2.73\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-2000\n","Generating samples...\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n","ails-on-this-golf-map-at-las-dunes-from-a-scout-a-babysitter-from-a-barbeque-golf-friend-from-an-a-dying-bud-drinking-mansion\n","<image_or_gif>\n","\n","‘This is so weird’, you say.\n","\n","\n","Yeah. But that doesn’t make it okay. It isn’t the best, not by a longshot, but this is still a great piece of art. The idea that it was so hard to play this at a hole-in-one tournament at the world’s highest elevation is still so impressive. To me, this is a work of art that should be on every golfer’s desk at work. \n","There’s a great photo of the actual hole-in-one golf course by Dan Moller.

It is a masterpiece.\n","You can see the rest of the golf art here:\n","<image_or_gif>\n","\n","“It”s still too much of a pain in the ass to win a round at a hole in-one. That’s really all there is. And I’m still very disappointed to see so much less attention paid to this on the golf course. People make the hole in-one golf course feel special, and then have a bad time going back. It’s weird. I could really use a new golf course to go back to in the next decade or so. No, I don’t think I’m the only person. Not only is the golf a pain in the ass, it’s also hard to score a hole-in-one as well. So when people are still doing holes in-ones at the world’s highest elevation, it’s a hard thing to do. I am also a golfer, though I don’t have a hole-in-one yet. \n","Yes, golf games should be made for all walks of life. Everyone deserves the freedom to play golf whether they live in the country or in a foreign country. Golf games should be made from all parts of the golfing population, not just the professional ones. And they need to be made for everyone. Not just those lucky people who don’t play golf.\n","\n","<|endoftext|>The Last of Us Director Talks About Gameplay, The Walking Dead\n","Author: Brian Crecente\n","<image_or_gif>\n","Sony Worldwide Studios head Shawn Layden's been on a conference call, talking about Gameplay and The Last of Us and other projects. \n","You can listen to the above recorded audio.\n","\n"," I guess we should assume that, no matter what Shawn says, he is talking about the current State of the Game.\n","This week, Sony Worldwide Studios will be holding its E3 media briefing, and they will be releasing some juicy tidbits from their press conference. \n","Some are interesting! Some are pretty damn embarrassing! \n","Here is what Sony said:\n","The most surprising thing is the fact that Shawn Layden - known as a 'game guy' and 'producer-in-chief' at Sony Worldwide Studios (SWOS) - isn't talking about the game itself. Well not really, but the game that the game guys have been looking forward to for a long time, a new title that will be an attempt to reboot the franchise. Well, not necessarily reboot the franchise, because the thing we're playing is from the previous game, The Last of Us.\n","What? No big deal! That’s just Shawn talking! No big deal. Except that this sounds like an attempt to reboots the series - that would be great.\n","\n"," [Audio - YouTube - Thanks Kajagoogol]\n","<|endoftext|>Wii-Eye-Powered Robot Battles\n","Author: Brian Ashcraft\n","<image_or_gif>\n","As we did with the Wii in 2013, the Wii U will provide a new kind for gamers to play video games. While it may be a gimmick at best, we’ll keep on watching and waiting for some real robots. After all, just as Nintendo is using 3D motion, Sony is using a 3D motion controller as well. If this is a real thing, it could help bring back those days where games looked like old fashioned arcade machines.\n","In honor of this, we’ll be showcasing some of the new games from Sony and the developers who will be participating.

He was the head guard of the Dragon Ball. He became friends with his classmates Goku and Kid Gohan at first but they soon broke down, and Yamashita was then the caretaker for the newly created island of Korin. In order to keep the island alive, he trained the other members.\n","Goku was a teenager that Yamashita took care of and trained to become a strong warrior. When he was about to enter the military academy, Yamashita was promoted to the rank of captain and became one of the top instructors of the academy. Later, during a battle against the evil god Zarbon, Goku and his friends won, defeating the evil monster, and the Dragon Ball got renamed to \"Dragon Ball\".\n","Gokū is a small boy who became a member of the military under the supervision of an old soldier that was raised by Yamashita. He served alongside Goku and his friends. He was a member of the Frieza's army that was the former ally of the Super Dragon Ball. He survived the Saiyan rebellion of the Frieza's, the Saiyan who were trained by Goku.\n","Usopp is a boy that was raised by Captain Yamashita and was a top instructor at the military academy. He fought against the super Saiyans that was used by the evil Dr. Satan to make the super Dragon Balls for Goku and others. When the evil Dr. Satan disappeared and returned to Earth, Usopp and the other students were all killed.\n","As the anime progressed, the show introduced new characters like Goten's brother Goten and Trunks' father Whis who had no known father. In the manga, it became apparent that Usopp and his friends are none other than the original five founders of the Dragon Ball universe (along with the original creators and creators of the Super Dragon Balls).\n","And then there is Vegeta, a character that seems to be the main character of the series. He is shown in the manga to be a very strong fighter with super strength and great regenerative ability. He was the original owner of the Dragon Balls and was the original hero of the series.\n","During the events of Dragon Ball GT , Vegeta is an opponent that is completely unknown to the main characters. He had been trained by the mysterious Goku, and had been in training by Yamashita. During the battle with the Super Dragon Balls, Vegeta has been shown to be stronger than Goku, and could beat Goku. If Vegeta can beat Goku, it means that the Dragon Ball is a better weapon.\n","And as we've already seen in the manga, the show has introduced more heroes and villains than ever before. The last few episodes of the anime featured the three main characters from the previous Dragon Ball Z animated series: Gogeta the human, Trunks the human and Vegeta.\n","The anime also introduces some new characters, including Piccolo the human; Vegeta the human; and Goten the human.\n","The new shows was praised for its creative story development and characters with distinctive designs. The characters' designs, voices and voices acted well. The animation in the anime was also well received, and has been described as the best the show has ever put out.\n","It had all the elements to make up a good live-action Dragon Ball. However, the anime was criticized due to its lack of direction and animation style. The anime also had problems with some of the characters' actions. When it comes to plot, it lacked any meaningful conflict. The ending was also criticized for over-saturation of the characters or lack of any development; the anime ended up having a little too much conflict. The anime wasn't well-written at all. Despite some clever references to the manga, it has still been regarded as one of the worst Dragon Ball TV series.\n","While the Dragon Ball anime did not get the same amount of criticism as the TV anime, it was still criticized on a certain level. The main complaints were that the series' writing was too simplistic and that the series' characters had very little personality, while at the same time, there were very few interactions and little development from the characters themselves. Also, some of the villains and other characters did not have character development. It is still said in some circles outside of Japan that this is still one of the most well-written Dragon Ball anime ever produced.\n","As a live-action film, some thought that it was a very good live-action film. However, in the anime it is still criticised for not developing more from the characters.\n","The anime was rated E for violence and sex appeal.\n","In spite of the rating, the anime had some good moments and even some good plot twists throughout the anime. However, the most prominent plot twist was the one regarding Piccolo and Vegeta\n","\n","[2100 | 1973.30] loss=2.50 avg=2.76\n","[2101 | 1974.89] loss=2.88 avg=2.76\n","[2102 | 1976.47] loss=2.25 avg=2.75\n","[2103 | 1978.06] loss=2.73 avg=2.75\n","[2104 | 1979.64] loss=2.24 avg=2.75\n","[2105 | 1981.23] loss=2.72 avg=2.75\n","[2106 | 1982.81] loss=2.66 avg=2.75\n","[2107 | 1984.40] loss=2.64 avg=2.75\n","[2108 | 1985.98] loss=2.93 avg=2.75\n","[2109 | 1987.55] loss=2.89 avg=2.75\n","[2110 | 1989.13] loss=2.73 avg=2.75\n","[2111 | 1990.72] loss=2.74 avg=2.75\n","[2112 | 1992.30] loss=2.97 avg=2.75\n","[2113 | 1993.88] loss=2.71 avg=2.75\n","[2114 | 1995.46] loss=2.66 avg=2.75\n","[2115 | 1997.04] loss=2.64 avg=2.75\n","[2116 | 1998.62] loss=2.40 avg=2.75\n","[2117 | 2000.22] loss=3.32 avg=2.75\n","[2118 | 2001.80] loss=2.78 avg=2.75\n","[2119 | 2003.39] loss=2.78 avg=2.75\n","[2120 | 2004.98] loss=2.61 avg=2.75\n","[2121 | 2006.57] loss=2.98 avg=2.75\n","[2122 | 2008.16] loss=2.54 avg=2.75\n","[2123 | 2009.75] loss=2.34 avg=2.75\n","[2124 | 2011.33] loss=2.67 avg=2.75\n","[2125 | 2012.92] loss=2.93 avg=2.75\n","[2126 | 2014.50] loss=2.63 avg=2.75\n","[2127 | 2016.09] loss=2.19 avg=2.74\n","[2128 | 2017.69] loss=2.87 avg=2.74\n","[2129 | 2019.28] loss=2.32 avg=2.74\n","[2130 | 2020.88] loss=2.71 avg=2.74\n","[2131 | 2022.47] loss=2.75 avg=2.74\n","[2132 | 2024.05] loss=3.12 avg=2.74\n","[2133 | 2025.65] loss=2.68 avg=2.74\n","[2134 | 2027.24] loss=2.68 avg=2.74\n","[2135 | 2028.83] loss=2.88 avg=2.74\n","[2136 | 2030.42] loss=2.65 avg=2.74\n","[2137 | 2032.02] loss=3.17 avg=2.75\n","[2138 | 2033.61] loss=2.23 avg=2.74\n","[2139 | 2035.20] loss=2.81 avg=2.74\n","[2140 | 2036.79] loss=2.81 avg=2.74\n","[2141 | 2038.38] loss=2.31 avg=2.74\n","[2142 | 2039.97] loss=2.82 avg=2.74\n","[2143 | 2041.56] loss=2.81 avg=2.74\n","[2144 | 2043.15] loss=2.48 avg=2.74\n","[2145 | 2044.73] loss=2.72 avg=2.74\n","[2146 | 2046.32] loss=2.96 avg=2.74\n","[2147 | 2047.91] loss=2.71 avg=2.74\n","[2148 | 2049.51] loss=2.76 avg=2.74\n","[2149 | 2051.10] loss=2.81 avg=2.74\n","[2150 | 2052.69] loss=2.65 avg=2.74\n","[2151 | 2054.27] loss=2.76 avg=2.74\n","[2152 | 2055.86] loss=2.52 avg=2.74\n","[2153 | 2057.44] loss=2.60 avg=2.73\n","[2154 | 2059.03] loss=2.48 avg=2.73\n","[2155 | 2060.62] loss=2.74 avg=2.73\n","[2156 | 2062.21] loss=2.99 avg=2.73\n","[2157 | 2063.80] loss=2.82 avg=2.74\n","[2158 | 2065.39] loss=2.99 avg=2.74\n","[2159 | 2066.98] loss=2.38 avg=2.73\n","[2160 | 2068.57] loss=2.49 avg=2.73\n","[2161 | 2070.16] loss=3.08 avg=2.74\n","[2162 | 2071.75] loss=2.65 avg=2.73\n","[2163 | 2073.34] loss=2.27 avg=2.73\n","[2164 | 2074.92] loss=2.80 avg=2.73\n","[2165 | 2076.51] loss=3.25 avg=2.74\n","[2166 | 2078.11] loss=2.59 avg=2.73\n","[2167 | 2079.69] loss=2.64 avg=2.73\n","[2168 | 2081.28] loss=2.59 avg=2.73\n","[2169 | 2082.87] loss=2.86 avg=2.73\n","[2170 | 2084.46] loss=2.91 avg=2.74\n","[2171 | 2086.05] loss=2.52 avg=2.73\n","[2172 | 2087.63] loss=1.17 avg=2.72\n","[2173 | 2089.22] loss=2.75 avg=2.72\n","[2174 | 2090.81] loss=2.85 avg=2.72\n","[2175 | 2092.40] loss=3.04 avg=2.72\n","[2176 | 2093.98] loss=2.80 avg=2.72\n","[2177 | 2095.57] loss=2.84 avg=2.72\n","[2178 | 2097.16] loss=3.26 avg=2.73\n","[2179 | 2098.75] loss=2.08 avg=2.72\n","[2180 | 2100.34] loss=2.50 avg=2.72\n","[2181 | 2101.93] loss=2.93 avg=2.72\n","[2182 | 2103.52] loss=1.84 avg=2.71\n","[2183 | 2105.11] loss=2.50 avg=2.71\n","[2184 | 2106.69] loss=2.99 avg=2.71\n","[2185 | 2108.28] loss=2.69 avg=2.71\n","[2186 | 2109.87] loss=2.66 avg=2.71\n","[2187 | 2111.46] loss=2.50 avg=2.71\n","[2188 | 2113.04] loss=3.04 avg=2.72\n","[2189 | 2114.62] loss=2.53 avg=2.71\n","[2190 | 2116.20] loss=2.43 avg=2.71\n","[2191 | 2117.78] loss=2.82 avg=2.71\n","[2192 | 2119.37] loss=2.01 avg=2.70\n","[2193 | 2120.96] loss=2.82 avg=2.71\n","[2194 | 2122.55] loss=2.62 avg=2.70\n","[2195 | 2124.12] loss=2.85 avg=2.71\n","[2196 | 2125.71] loss=2.73 avg=2.71\n","[2197 | 2127.30] loss=2.96 avg=2.71\n","[2198 | 2128.89] loss=2.26 avg=2.70\n","[2199 | 2130.48] loss=2.41 avg=2.70\n","Generating samples...\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n"," Keith Haring, is set to release his next film, the long-awaited follow-up to the acclaimed Dark Messiah.

It was called 'Tetris, which was the first real-time role-playing game. Players used the controller to control an armillary sphere from one of a number of different worlds.

There’re more to it than that. The co-op mode of course allows you to play as the first human.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","Of course there’s the campaign mode. It looks like it’s much, much bigger. It’s full of new stuff and even more stuff. There’s a lot to see and explore. It also seems to be filled with new bugs and issues.\n","All the campaign stuff is a bit limited but it’ll be nice to go back to that place and play. It’ll give you a chance to play with some other Titan people you’ve met up, learn more about what’s going on around you and do some nice little side missions so you’ve got a little more rope rope.\n","The campaign’s been out for around two weeks now but it’s getting bigger and bigger. I’d say the game’s still only one and a half to two-and-a-half hours. It’s far too long to actually play and I wouldn’t want to. I’ve got a big pile of missions to complete in-game. \n","But I like Titanfall.\n","It’s the kind of big game where you’re going to feel compelled to play a lot more than once after that. So that’s why I’ve been playing so much Titanfall 2.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","One thing that’ll be missing in the new Titanfall is that otherworldly feeling. A lack of that. I’m still hoping that will be added in for sure (not really).\n","<|endoftext|>Wii Fit Plus Is Getting Another Update: A Better Balance Board\n","Author: Luke Plunkett\n","<image_or_gif>\n","You're going to want to take an extra 20-30 minutes this morning to check out the update to your wii fitness board. If Nintendo of America hasn’t done this already, it’s probably too important to the development of Wii Fitness.\n","Yesterday I’d had my Wii Fit 2 and then my fitness trainer working the Wii Balance Board, so I’m really glad I’ve spent an hour on yesterday’s update.\n","As well as introducing some new features, the update also introduces some fixes. \n","The board itself has received a few tweaks. It’s now slightly wider and slightly slimmer, and it feels smoother to use. The board also has a more responsive and more intuitive button-based control of the Wii Fit, so if you’ve got the Wii Balance Board you’ll be much more in sync with your partner this time around.\n","The board also receives some new features.\n","It’s now possible to connect your wireless fitness device to a Wii MotionPlus or Wii MotionPlus Pro. Once it’s connected, your Wii Fit 2 can detect whether the device or the board is connected to your computer and then automatically switches it on when it’s time for a fitness session.\n","The board is also now easier to use. There’s a new 'Quick Fit' button, which lets you quick-press your fitness device’\n","\n","[2400 | 2514.73] loss=2.74 avg=2.71\n","[2401 | 2516.32] loss=2.69 avg=2.70\n","[2402 | 2517.91] loss=2.84 avg=2.71\n","[2403 | 2519.50] loss=2.96 avg=2.71\n","[2404 | 2521.09] loss=2.59 avg=2.71\n","[2405 | 2522.67] loss=2.13 avg=2.70\n","[2406 | 2524.26] loss=2.60 avg=2.70\n","[2407 | 2525.85] loss=2.71 avg=2.70\n","[2408 | 2527.43] loss=2.76 avg=2.70\n","[2409 | 2529.02] loss=2.59 avg=2.70\n","[2410 | 2530.61] loss=3.06 avg=2.70\n","[2411 | 2532.19] loss=3.07 avg=2.71\n","[2412 | 2533.78] loss=3.46 avg=2.72\n","[2413 | 2535.36] loss=2.58 avg=2.71\n","[2414 | 2536.95] loss=2.31 avg=2.71\n","[2415 | 2538.53] loss=3.66 avg=2.72\n","[2416 | 2540.11] loss=2.87 avg=2.72\n","[2417 | 2541.70] loss=2.43 avg=2.72\n","[2418 | 2543.28] loss=3.20 avg=2.72\n","[2419 | 2544.87] loss=2.70 avg=2.72\n","[2420 | 2546.46] loss=2.52 avg=2.72\n","[2421 | 2548.04] loss=2.56 avg=2.72\n","[2422 | 2549.63] loss=2.60 avg=2.72\n","[2423 | 2551.21] loss=2.51 avg=2.72\n","[2424 | 2552.80] loss=2.77 avg=2.72\n","[2425 | 2554.38] loss=2.36 avg=2.71\n","[2426 | 2555.97] loss=2.25 avg=2.71\n","[2427 | 2557.56] loss=2.33 avg=2.70\n","[2428 | 2559.14] loss=2.60 avg=2.70\n","[2429 | 2560.72] loss=3.60 avg=2.71\n","[2430 | 2562.31] loss=2.66 avg=2.71\n","[2431 | 2563.90] loss=2.46 avg=2.71\n","[2432 | 2565.49] loss=2.27 avg=2.70\n","[2433 | 2567.08] loss=2.74 avg=2.70\n","[2434 | 2568.67] loss=3.16 avg=2.71\n","[2435 | 2570.26] loss=3.19 avg=2.71\n","[2436 | 2571.85] loss=3.15 avg=2.72\n","[2437 | 2573.44] loss=2.47 avg=2.72\n","[2438 | 2575.03] loss=2.96 avg=2.72\n","[2439 | 2576.63] loss=2.49 avg=2.72\n","[2440 | 2578.22] loss=2.81 avg=2.72\n","[2441 | 2579.80] loss=2.93 avg=2.72\n","[2442 | 2581.39] loss=2.99 avg=2.72\n","[2443 | 2582.97] loss=2.58 avg=2.72\n","[2444 | 2584.56] loss=3.02 avg=2.72\n","[2445 | 2586.15] loss=2.95 avg=2.73\n","[2446 | 2587.74] loss=3.30 avg=2.73\n","[2447 | 2589.33] loss=2.32 avg=2.73\n","[2448 | 2590.92] loss=2.55 avg=2.73\n","[2449 | 2592.51] loss=2.34 avg=2.72\n","[2450 | 2594.10] loss=2.84 avg=2.72\n","[2451 | 2595.69] loss=2.39 avg=2.72\n","[2452 | 2597.28] loss=3.13 avg=2.72\n","[2453 | 2598.87] loss=2.74 avg=2.72\n","[2454 | 2600.46] loss=2.61 avg=2.72\n","[2455 | 2602.05] loss=0.97 avg=2.71\n","[2456 | 2603.64] loss=2.84 avg=2.71\n","[2457 | 2605.23] loss=2.70 avg=2.71\n","[2458 | 2606.82] loss=3.09 avg=2.71\n","[2459 | 2608.42] loss=3.62 avg=2.72\n","[2460 | 2610.01] loss=2.81 avg=2.72\n","[2461 | 2611.59] loss=2.96 avg=2.72\n","[2462 | 2613.19] loss=2.77 avg=2.72\n","[2463 | 2614.79] loss=3.07 avg=2.73\n","[2464 | 2616.38] loss=1.21 avg=2.71\n","[2465 | 2617.97] loss=2.73 avg=2.71\n","[2466 | 2619.56] loss=3.21 avg=2.72\n","[2467 | 2621.15] loss=2.32 avg=2.71\n","[2468 | 2622.74] loss=2.73 avg=2.71\n","[2469 | 2624.33] loss=2.77 avg=2.71\n","[2470 | 2625.92] loss=2.48 avg=2.71\n","[2471 | 2627.50] loss=2.06 avg=2.70\n","[2472 | 2629.09] loss=2.71 avg=2.70\n","[2473 | 2630.69] loss=2.32 avg=2.70\n","[2474 | 2632.26] loss=2.70 avg=2.70\n","[2475 | 2633.85] loss=2.95 avg=2.70\n","[2476 | 2635.45] loss=2.75 avg=2.70\n","[2477 | 2637.04] loss=2.79 avg=2.70\n","[2478 | 2638.63] loss=2.79 avg=2.71\n","[2479 | 2640.22] loss=2.57 avg=2.70\n","[2480 | 2641.81] loss=2.92 avg=2.71\n","[2481 | 2643.41] loss=2.66 avg=2.71\n","[2482 | 2645.00] loss=3.03 avg=2.71\n","[2483 | 2646.59] loss=2.68 avg=2.71\n","[2484 | 2648.18] loss=2.84 avg=2.71\n","[2485 | 2649.76] loss=2.59 avg=2.71\n","[2486 | 2651.36] loss=2.57 avg=2.71\n","[2487 | 2652.95] loss=2.79 avg=2.71\n","[2488 | 2654.54] loss=2.65 avg=2.71\n","[2489 | 2656.13] loss=2.50 avg=2.71\n","[2490 | 2657.71] loss=2.48 avg=2.70\n","[2491 | 2659.30] loss=2.25 avg=2.70\n","[2492 | 2660.89] loss=2.74 avg=2.70\n","[2493 | 2662.48] loss=2.52 avg=2.70\n","[2494 | 2664.06] loss=3.13 avg=2.70\n","[2495 | 2665.66] loss=2.80 avg=2.70\n","[2496 | 2667.25] loss=0.80 avg=2.68\n","[2497 | 2668.84] loss=2.24 avg=2.68\n","[2498 | 2670.43] loss=2.25 avg=2.68\n","[2499 | 2672.01] loss=3.28 avg=2.68\n","Generating samples...\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n"," in the game itself, or that there'd been any other significant gameplay changes in terms of weapons and such since the last console release.\n","The problem with that theory though is that the change in the console version of the game may be a result of some other changes in the engine. For instance, in the game's launch version the AI wasn't programmed to be able to be switched off. It's possible, but unlikely that that happened in the console version.\n","That said, many new players would do well to read the comments on this post, as they may just be curious to know what other things changed compared to the last game. Let's see if we can shed some light on what that might be today.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","In March of 2008, Bethesda announced that the game was coming out in a \"big change\" for the next Xbox-generation. It was slated to be a \"big game, big action.\"\n","In other words, the game featured a lot of big gameplay changes. This was particularly true of the game's online servers. While many players seemed to be happy with the console version, it was no secret the Xbox version was getting its fix of big online changes over the last console-generation.\n","The Xbox version of Far Cry 3 will also feature a lot of new game features, including a new, full 3D graphics card control system, improved gun accuracy, and new customization options.\n","The PC version of the game will be able to handle 3D. PC game players will be able to run the game at 60 frames per second and have a better option for resolution settings.\n","A lot of those new features are new to PC players, but the console version can handle some of the new online game features and graphics cards. That's because console gamers already have the PC version of the game running.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","There's also the issue of the new console hardware. The Xbox version of the Far Cry 3 game will run at 30 frames per second (which is more than what was on the PC). The PC will play at 60 frames per second, but will run at a lower resolution than the old game.\n","That's not a huge change, mind, but it does put a bit of a damper on the console game. But it doesn't stop the console version of the game from being a lot of fun.\n","Even more interesting to me was the Xbox 360 version of Far Cry 3's online servers. In the game's launch version, the network was handled by a third-party company, and so online had a lot of limitations. The only thing they were sharing was the location of the server to connect to.\n","In the game, you could connect to your PC to play a local server with up to 8 players, which is very nice. I know the online servers in the Xbox version won't include the whole map, meaning you and your friends have to take turns to connect to a server.\n","Still, it would have been nice to be able to just connect to a server whenever you wanted online. In other words, Far Cry 3 was a lot more fun when you weren't connected to an old online server. \n","But on the bright side of PC gaming is a new way to work on the game. The game's creators are planning on allowing players to \"save their progress\" to the cloud, which means that your game saves itself from the time it took to access the new game, so that you can work on the game on your own time, even if it's not your computer's time.\n","This is great. And I mean this in the best possible way — all the games can use your game's save files, no matter where they are placed on the computer. For PC games to work perfectly with Far Cry 3's cloud save, I think you'd have to be a modder; most console players already know how to mod.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","Far Cry 3 will still have an Xbox 360 or PS3 version, but there won't be many differences. The Xbox 360 version is still slated to have an \"unannounced\" level editor. So it may take some of the fun Far Cry 3 has to offer, but it'll get plenty more.\n","Here's what the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the same game will be able to do.\n","To start off with, you have multiplayer with some friends online. After some time has passed, you can pick someone up from the Xbox Live area of the game, and you'll be able join up with them. Once you do, you can move to each other and continue the game.\n","To use the game's 3D cameras, this is what they showed during the console-only reveal.

Let's say you are looking for something to be good and bad about, and you're not going to find it here.\n","\n","* There's a lot of good in this game. Everything you love about Uncharted is present here. You'll travel across the country (including all the parts we've just touched on), and you'll learn new things about the Uncharted universe, particularly the first game's great open-world, and the game will teach you a lot about the original games.\n","That's great!\n","* Uncharted 2's gameplay also has some very good features in it that can sometimes be the biggest draws for the franchise. The main reason why we're praising Uncharted 3 here is that the series has always had a really good story. That means the bad stuff doesn't ruin it for us, and the good stuff does.\n","But we've got other reasons too.\n","* The Uncharted series has always had a strong and rich mythology to draw on. The three games we are reviewing are all excellent tales of exploration and discovery, and the new adventure—including its own mythology, which we are highlighting here—is no exception.\n","* The first game of the series was very good, which means there is an expectation of going into the new one expecting to be disappointed if (like, say) the first game was your saviour of all adventure games. The old formula hasn't changed in a while, at least when we expect something new.\n","* The new one does a better job at giving a deeper understanding of the original series' characters and their stories, and the game doesn't try\n","\n","[2700 | 3056.10] loss=2.77 avg=2.68\n","[2701 | 3057.67] loss=3.04 avg=2.69\n","[2702 | 3059.26] loss=2.74 avg=2.69\n","[2703 | 3060.84] loss=2.62

The game makes use of the \"tune\" system, which is used in some Mario games. This game also lets you control your character's speed and jumping ability, which make it easy to switch from level-up to level-down in a few seconds.\n","The second and final mode we played used a combination of physics and music, which makes music feel as if it's being played by both the developers and the listeners. \n","But the game really does all of that work, and more. The \"music\" mode takes some of the game's best ideas and adds more to it. It makes the music for the game feel like it's a musical score as opposed to some \"outtake\" that's only being played by the composer. You can play it through to the end or not, which gives the game room to breathe and to develop its own theme. This makes each track stand out and keep the music from simply being just another track on an album, something you'll hear but not necessarily notice.\n","There's also a little bit of sound editing, which lets you make certain sounds change depending on what happens in each track you listen to—which is an interesting mechanic, and it's neat to hear what you make of a track. \n","It's also worth noting that while the game tracks the music with a bunch of different buttons and some fancy sounds you might expect, it does all of this through a nice \"tone deck\" system.

This latest creation has me wondering: What the hell is wrong with games that have players interacting, not competing with one another?\n","I’ve been a programmer and a game designer for a little over a decade, and I’ve worked on games like Grand Theft Auto, Halo, and Assassin’s Creed. I’ve always loved to interact with my players. I like to see their eyes glaze over—at least for a bit. I like to see them relax and have fun. I like to see them be creative and imaginative.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","But I’ve noticed that, while some games are a little less interactive—such as a game like Destiny that’s been around since 2010—many more have been just about the opposite. Most games have no more interaction with you than that—you’re just standing there clicking, attacking, and then...there’s a match. For some games, however, you’re actually competing with each other in some games; it’s a match—a match where you can win, or lose—but your opponent has to make a decision, and your opponent has to make a choice.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","Here’s a classic, from one of my favorites...\n","<image_or_gif>\n","I’d say the same about other video games, too. I’ve also noticed that while game designers are often very busy with many other endeavors—such as making new games—not too many game designers can actually keep up with what’s out there. The games they’ve been able to make over the years are largely of a similar mold.\n","\n","I guess I’ve noticed that, at least in the last dozen years, videogames haven’t really been about interacting. They’ve been more about creating, a game about creating, a game that is designed to be fun, so if somebody can’t like it, forget it, no matter what it’s about. It’s more focused around gameplay, and more about the fun part, so to speak…<image_or_gif>\n","Well, even with all the things I’ve done in the past fifteen years, I don’t really feel like I got my shot in GTA IV, for example. I know I’ve been given some very exciting opportunities, but to my utter sadness I’ve never had the opportunity to work on the game that’s been out almost entirely since 2010.\n","I guess that’s why I’m kind of bumptiously making a video, instead of having a game in the works that’s my own. I just feel like I’ve been so blessed with a wonderful team, and the things I’ve been given, it’ll be so difficult to put this past me…\n","<gif_or_video>\n","For the past three years, I’ve been at the absolute bottom of a career for a game designer, not unlike the bottom of a career for an astronaut or a writer. I’ve done very little working or learning, and have been able to simply sit back, relax, and not really think about what the next ten-year stretch can hold—because I’ve gotten so lucky in the past few years.\n","And while there’s a lot of things I can’t change, I don’t feel like I have much to fix now...\n","\n","<|endoftext|>Kotaku\n","Author: Nathan Grayson\n","<image_or_gif>\n","If you play video games on your PlayStation 3, you can get some of the same upgrades available on your PC, as The Old Republic has introduced the ability to buy and sell items with your real money.

There's also a game called Tug of War, which is an open-world racer. It's a year, so you could try to beat it in eight months. Then I went home.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","<image_or_gif>\n","<image_or_gif>\n","<|endoftext|>Kotaku\n","Author: Luke Plunkett\n","<image_or_gif>\n","Namco Bandai have made yet another announcement today at Tokyo Game Show. They've updated the game with a new setting, a new map, a new character, new weapons, new vehicles, better maps and a new world, which promises to feature 'The Dark Continent'. The Namco Bandai blog promises more details later today.\n","<|endoftext|>A Lot Of Game-Making And A Lot of It is In Skyrim’s Creation Kit\n","Author: Luke Plunkett\n","<image_or_gif>\n","Kotaku's Kotaku East is a pretty fantastic place to spend time when you’re bored or have a lot to do. If that’s your thing then you’re going to want to check out our Game Maker section as we go over the best free tools, apps and games you've ever found on mobile or PC.\n","One of our favourites is the Creation Kit, which lets you easily create maps and create your own story in Skyrim. If you play on PC at all you’ll have to wait for the modding tools to come to the game. But we’ll still be here when the creation kit kicks in.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","<image_or_gif>\n","<image_or_gif>\n","<image_or_gif>\n","<|endoftext|>Pikachu-Sized Metroid Vs. Nintendo-Sized Pokemon\n","Author: Brian Ashcraft\n","<image_or_gif>\n","A new Pokemon-sized action game and some familiar Metroid-sized action games are about to collide. Both Nintendo and Nintendo of America are expected to announce a Nintendo 2DS game on September 5 at E3.\n","This is part of a larger series of announcements made by Nintendo regarding new Nintendo products: Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo NX coming this fall, the first Nintendo console being announced this year and the next in a line of three coming to the world during 2015. \n","Both the Nintendo 2DS portable and the Nintendo 3DS XL will feature a Super Nintendo-size home screen, which could be taken to the extreme. This new Nintendo GamePad accessory will be more like a tablet or a gaming accessory than a display. Perhaps the best part of the Nintendo 2DS XL is the fact that these two smaller devices can sit so neatly next to each other?\n","Both games on the list of possible games are scheduled to be released this fall. \n","Nintendo's new Nintendo 2DS and Nintendo 3DS XL will be released this fall in bundles that include both Nintendo 3DS games as well as a new game for Nintendo 3DS. One could be Nintendo NX, a little different than the NX game for the original Nintendo system. One could be a new game for the Nintendo Portable System that has both an \"art\" and a \"play\" element.\n","Both games have unique game icons (called Pokémon-sized), the same for each system. Both could be released simultaneously on both of the Nintendo 3DS' two screens. Nintendo 3DS games and Nintendo Portable system-exclusive game content on one device could release together on both Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Portable.\n","While nothing has been officially confirmed yet, Nintendo would seem likely to release both Nintendo DS mini games and the NX games on the NDS system simultaneously.\n","Both games will also be available on portable versions of Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS, and both\n","\n","[3100 | 3784.54] loss=2.67 avg=2.64\n","[3101 | 3786.13] loss=2.75 avg=2.64\n","[3102 | 3787.72] loss=3.20 avg=2.64\n","[3103 | 3789.30] loss=3.08 avg=2.65\n","[3104 |

It takes awhile, but once summoned, you can use it like any other weapon. So, if you have an open field and a bunch of enemies (which doesn't happen very often, though it does happen often in dungeons and/or when traveling from dungeon to dungeon), this sword-use is a good way to make your way out while still having someone around to do the hard stuff. It also comes in handy for dungeons that don't have a lot of enemies, since it can be used to quickly break off sections from the main quest.\n","The rest of these powers are great in and of themselves, but there's a ton more you unlock as you play through each dungeon and get to know them better. For example, the boss of each dungeon can tell its story for one or two stages. A boss fight in Castle O'Hara is a completely different story from, say, the last boss of Ocarina of Time, but since there have been only a couple of boss fights in this series, you don't really have much of a choice but to get excited about all the different ways that they interact, even when you don't have to.\n","Each dungeon also features some cool, unexpected side-quests. For example: a dungeon called Blackwing Lair can make you unlock the sword you've been searching for, but it's got a ton of stuff you might not expect. For example, Link can use the sword to seal a room inside Ocarina of Time, and also when Link dies, he can then access the sword for the rest of the game. I can't wait to see the results of such a dungeon, and there's a great deal of room for experimentation in the dungeons themselves. Also, since the dungeon isn't really a solo experience, you can play as many times as you like and still get to see new dungeons in a new way, depending on how your friends play and how well you can coordinate your attempts.\n","The dungeons can be quite long—though if you like your Zelda games to seem like you do solo experiences, those long, repetitive dungeons tend to be pretty boring. There is one other thing, though. A new dungeon in Twilight Princess is pretty fun, and in fact the only thing I can say is that I'm very, very glad I'm already playing it. The other reason I can't think of anything better to say about this dungeon is that its structure may make you think, like I do, that they might really be trying something new, and that you're not getting the whole thing. But honestly, you don't lose anything. Even though you've unlocked the sword, you can't use it until you leave this particular dungeon, so if you're doing these dungeons as a group, then it probably doesn’t have much of an effect. You can still play the same dungeons, unless you want the extra bonus of playing them as a Link.\n","One more thing on dungeons: the dungeons in the Breath of the Wild games do not have many boss battles, aside from bosses who you fight for the first time. What the heck is going on with that? Well, after all, if you’re playing as Link at the beginning and you’re doing dungeons as many as you like, you’ll beat a lot of bosses for free. And as with all things Zelda, the bosses in Breath of the Wild are pretty darn good. So yeah, this may be why you play as Link. You’re really just playing dungeons as you like.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","In terms of dungeons, I’m not sure I have an answer at this point. It’s possible that many of the dungeons in Breath of the Wild are just small, single-character affairs (like the dungeons in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess). It’s possible that they are all about the same thing: puzzles. There is no point in telling you how to make each cave go the right way, or how to make the right exit. The dungeons themselves are, in theory, not very interesting.

I'm sure the result is a gorgeous, charming game. When I sat down to play Cherry Beach: The Lost, though, I was struck by what a gorgeous game it is.\n","This was not just a game, mind you, it's an interactive book full of hand-drawn characters and puzzles. Cherry Beach: The Lost is a visual novel adaptation of Yotsuba Akagi's original novel of the same name. The first book in the series, the game takes place during the 1930s in the rural town of Soga. The player is a young girl on the verge of adolescence, and the player takes the role of Akagi as she travels through the game with Akagi, one of many characters. The player's job is to save the boy who seems to have taken all of Cherry Beach. I didn't feel like I was in the middle of anything or else it would've made me nervous, but I did discover a sense of mystery and wonder that is all its own and really helps set it apart from other games in the series. (We do have a very Japanese take on the word \"dekukkatsu\" which is \"a mysterious place.\" I'm not sure I've ever heard that word in an RPG before.)\n","<image_or_gif>\n","There's an abundance of detail in the game's art style—the characters themselves are drawn very well, with each character looking like an exquisite creation. The backgrounds are rich with characters and some of the locations are beautiful—certain buildings seem just a little bit out of place, like the place where Akagi, who only appears in the game in flashback sequence, meets one of the main characters. Everything is crafted in a way that brings it into the age of games, the way a game should be. The game even seems more like a novel than a game. In the novels, each character plays a big part. The game follows the same basic formula: the girl and the boy. The girl appears at the start of the game, and her main goal is to rescue Akagi (and keep her from becoming Akagi). She's a single mother and doesn't take any role in the story itself. There's no way that the two would've shared a common goal. Also, the main character's appearance in the novel is much different from her appearance in the game, and the game doesn't have her wearing her glasses.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","The game's story doesn't have a very happy ending, either. All of the characters are killed off before the game's end and the young boy Akagi dies at the end, and while she's gone, the character of Akagi who has been living in Soga—a town which appears to be a typical American town—gets killed in an accident where she runs over a few of the townspeople. He's the main character's older sister who he is worried about. She's not in the game, but he will be once Akagi is gone, and this game is a good indicator of the kind of game this was—Akagi is a very well crafted character. At times it could've been a bit sad, but it still wasn't too bad. The game gives you a huge number of options as to how the characters should be dealt with. It also explains what happened in this one scene from the back of each book that Akagi has died—which is really amazing.\n","Cherry Beach: The Lost [Official Site]\n","<|endoftext|>Modding Games Is No Exciting Time But What It Is For\n","Author: Kirk Hamilton\n","<image_or_gif>\n","Modding is the art of making games.

you're describing a character. Most people don't know the name of someone who has been dead for decades, so instead of being able to say he was a \"ninth century historian,\" you use the term when talking about characters who were born in the 12th century. In this case, that's Marcus Aurelius, who was the 12th century emperor of Rome.\n","And even more telling, it's more accurate to use this term when talking about an event in a historical record.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","So yeah. Marcus Aurelius is probably the greatest thing that has happened in pop culture since the dawn of human history, so naturally he's also one of the greatest authors to have written. In this case, he was the hero of the Roman Empire and Roman history generally. In my view he won't be remembered as much as he really was, but he's probably the most famous and interesting writer since Homer.\n","If you really want a more detailed list: Who was the most influential writer in the history of the world? Who wrote the best stories? Who wrote the most important books? Who invented the world around them? Who created the most popular or best song? Who invented the most popular or best TV show? Who invented the most popular or best movie? Who invented the most famous games? Who invented the most famous movies? Who invented the most famous comic books? Who invented the most famous TV shows?\n","As for most interesting pop cultures, only a few are actually noteworthy: Greece, Rome, and the Japanese.\n","What were the best pop culture moments of the 20th century? The 20 best things about the first 50 years of the 21st? In what years were the worst?\n","<image_or_gif>\n","When it comes to history, I'd say we're in the midst of the best half yet. There's been quite a bit of very good stuff coming out just in the last few years about how great people like George W. Bush and Donald W. Obama actually were—not to mention the last 30 years of great stuff, like the last five years of great stuff.\n","Is it better that way? Yes. Are we getting the complete story right? No, perhaps the best part of living in a post-fact world is the ability to see the stories unfolding in your own backyard, or to follow the threads of culture or history, which is something we seem to have lost.\n","I love what I do for a living, and in some ways I feel like the more I know about human history, the better. If I were to write a book about the last 40 years of American history today—or the entire history of the last 100 years—it probably wouldn't be complete. It would be incomplete and incomplete in ways that will take years to fully digest and get over.\n","What I want, though, is to be able to look back at a particular moment in history and figure out the people, events, places, and things that made the most impact on society and the world around us. That's a much better way to understand an era from an individual's point of view. If you know enough history about one event, you can figure out who made the most amazing or saddest decisions in that period. You don't always need the context to know who got elected or why.\n","I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to the Kotaku community for being the best readers and commenters around. I love hearing from you about what you're reading, what you're doing, what you're most excited about, and what you think is the funniest thing you read this week. I also love hearing from you about the things you're most interested in talking about on the site. It's always good to have someone to chat about a hobby or a subject that interests you.\n","Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported me over the last year. You've been amazing. You're the best.\n","You can reach me at sean@kotaku.com or on Twitter at @jasonschreier.\n","<|endoftext|>A Very Special \"Brief\" Game Trailer\n","Author: Brian Ashcraft\n","<gif_or_video>\n","A very special \"Brief\" video from BioWare for the upcoming \"Mass Effect\" game series in theaters this September.

But these aren't really what you're hoping to hear about. These are the names of some of the many people I've spoken with about the game, people who've gone to events, had interactions on Twitter and had chats on the forums about what to expect going in. They've talked about the story. They've talked about the characters. Heck, they've even had the time to write their thoughts down so you can read them in a journal you can keep your own. Here's what they've said.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","One of the reasons I love The Walking Dead is that it's so very different from everything else. It plays like nothing else I've played. It's a huge world. You can go back to every time you go to the same place. You see all this and have a great time with this and like it. It's a little bit like being in a videogame. There's such a big, open world, and it comes with a rich, unique cast. Most of which you've played or played together already. And even when you're new to the world, they all feel a little familiar. They all seem a little familiar to me.\n","But it's the interactions that make the world special. I won't get into too many details about those, because they'll be spoiled when the game comes out, and will likely be spoiled anyway by the release itself, but I will say that one thing that keeps me coming back is how fun it is to see some of the cast interact with one another all the time, both literally and figuratively. You get the feeling of being in a video game and having to make decisions.\n","They have a bit of a big love story, which I actually like in a game. The two main characters, Tyreese and Rick, both feel a little on the outside of this town. But it's very difficult to talk to them about things because they're different people, and it's very hard to talk to them about things because they're so different in so many ways. There are different opinions on them, but for the whole story in the game, the two of them are almost inseparably linked. They are like brothers or sisters—if you say something interesting to Rick and he responds with a smile.\n","They do have a great dynamic. They both kind of try to do different things to get what they want in life. Rick's not really up to much beyond doing some basic stuff and then taking care of his father. Tyreese is so much more than simple. She'll do anything to get what she wants, and then even try to do things herself if she feels like making the best of things. Sometimes it works, in part because she has a sense of responsibility to try and make sure that things are the way they possibly can be. But most of the time, it's about doing their own thing and just doing it as they see fit. They're both the best of friends with the other characters. They're both doing their own thing and their own thing. They're just in the right place at the right time to do their own thing.\n","The interesting thing about Tyreese is that she has this great depth and complexity as a character. You don't see how deep the character is. You don't see what kind of person she is or what she's about, but you do see the fact how her relationships are very layered. I don't think anyone else on the cast is as complex. That's not down to Tyreese; that's down to the dynamic between them. It's almost a side story as part of what makes them so special.\n","There's a great romance between Lori and the one who was killed in the first episode.\n","I loved the way that the relationship worked. At the end of the season, Rick and Tyreese's relationship is very personal, and Rick's very much a surrogate father figure to Lori. It's a very real, very tender relationship, but the way it's portrayed in the first four episodes is very strong. And it works in a way that's really fun, and interesting. It's this big moment in a great way, and it's also so well-done. And it's very well-deserved, and I'm really looking forward to the end of the season.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","So you have a character who I just described as being a very different character than a lot of other characters you meet. A human who's trying to make a difference. A lot of the relationships in the first season were sort of this sort of platonic thing where Rick's a good father figure, and Tyreese is a good mother figure. And what we find out is that they're both really different in so many ways. There's a bit of a conflict in there, but I really like the chemistry between them.

You can, for example, download this card and use it as the first gift card of any new card you want to purchase. You can also order a gift certificate with money or cash and use that money to pay for the gift card. \n","There's a lot of potential here: You are spending money, and the store is accepting that money for your purchase. You can even get a gift certificate with money because it is the first time you have used their service. Or, you can be a jerk and get cash because you want that card so badly. \n","The bottom line is this: Shop with a gift certificate in mind! And do it early! And don't make them leave you in the dark.\n","What do Steam and Amazon do with gift certificates? \n","While they are not directly making money off digital purchases through Steam or Amazon directly, they are able to make money off some of Steam’s users’ purchasing cards through Amazon’s store. According to the Steam Community guidelines, Steam users are able to buy cards with virtual coins or real money through these games. This is a way to use their store to get more value out of their customers. There is not a huge amount of data on how much Steam or Amazon use gift cards and how much they make, as the details are kept behind closed doors. The community guidelines also say that gift cards are not approved for use by Amazon in their stores, so they are effectively buying Steam users’ card, in order to use it within Amazon. The problem for most players is that Steam and Amazon seem to have no problem with users using real money to pay for their purchases. There are a few cases where users have had to pay a little extra to get better deals. \n","“As more and more merchants are becoming game publishers and accepting Steam transactions, we will make the necessary changes to the way these transactions work,” Steam stated in May. The Steam Store “takes payment from the user for purchasing games in games on Steam’s platform and makes money through purchases on Steam’s merchant platform.” The community guidelines still say that gift cards may be used within Steam’s games but that the user's account may not be able to take advantage of that.\n","How do I get a gift certificate on Steam?\n","Step one: Install Steam on your PC, and add the game that you want to gift certificate for. Make sure that the game you want to purchase is compatible with Steam by clicking that button on the lower right hand corner of the Steam Settings screen.\n","The gift certificate will work fine for games that are not listed on the Valve storefront.

The game won't be released outside of Japan, as per usual.\n","For years, Persona 4 fans have wondered what happened to the protagonist known as Akihiko, who is presumed dead. Last year, Atlus took the lead, with the series' director, Yuji Naka, tweeting that the character will make \"a comeback\" in a new game. But since then, fans have wondered if it was all a hoax. The game will feature new characters, and was apparently cancelled for unknown reasons several months before the release date. Now Kotaku can reveal that it was all an elaborate hoax.\n","Nakano, the game's director who has confirmed the hoax, told Kotaku that the protagonist will make a comeback and that the game was made under the orders of president and CEO Yukio Matsumoto and CEO Naotaka Sato.\n","\"We had to have [a] big plan, to build the game. And I think, it was definitely planned as a reality. I said it, there's a story and a direction but the whole thing is just a hoax. And the reason for that is that we don't have it ready for production.\" Nakano added.\n","The hoax, however, has received a bit of a backlash online. Many, especially on Twitter, believe that Persona 4 Golden will be a fake, even if it will contain many of the same elements seen in previous Persona games. \"This is definitely a fake game with all the signs and symptoms that it is a fake game,\" said Yojiro Sakaguchi, the voice actor of the titular character. \"Let's not talk about things like Persona 4: Dancing All Night at night, or what people may think.\" The \"rumors\" have been so negative that Atlus has had to respond to many of them with a public apology. The company has even launched an official Twitter and Facebook account dedicated to debunking the rumors.\n","\"While the games released by the series are great, it is important to note that many of the things mentioned are fictional and have no relation to the series,\" Atlus PR and communications chief Michi Koshiyama said. \"The idea is to share the joy of playing the game with friends, and to let everyone feel it as soon as possible.\"\n","A series legend with nearly 30 years of Persona work working for Atlus, Nakano believes his hoax was created by the publisher, but he thinks it was an elaborate deception to trick players. \"[I]f you think it's not a hoax but because the game is canceled, this is what happens,\" Nakano said. That \"this\" is probably a hoax, too. When asked if some of the rumors are legitimate, Nakano had this to say:\n","Some fans are still skeptical of the hoax. Some are asking how Nakano found the files and the real game's story. However, that's not necessarily because he faked the files or the game; it's more that he didn't want to reveal things that are secret.\n","\"People do have the right to know things that they have a right to know, but to know things\n","\n","[4100 | 5594.91] loss=2.43 avg=2.61\n","[4101 | 5596.50] loss=2.84 avg=2.61\n","[4102 | 5598.09] loss=3.04 avg=2.61\n","[4103 | 5599.67] loss=3.00 avg=2.62\n","[4104 | 5601.26] loss=2.77 avg=2.62\n","[4105 | 5602.84] loss=2.69 avg=2.62\n","[4106 | 5604.43] loss=2.81 avg=2.62\n","[4107 | 5606.01] loss=2.83 avg=2.62\n","[4108 | 5607.60] loss=2.14 avg=2.62\n","[4109 | 5609.18] loss=2.24 avg=2.61\n","[4110 | 5610.77] loss=2.63 avg=2.62\n","[4111 | 5612.35] loss=2.53 avg=2.61\n","[4112 | 5613.93] loss=2.26 avg=2.61\n","[4113 | 5615.51] loss=2.54 avg=2.61\n","[4114 | 5617.10] loss=2.66 avg=2.61\n","[4115 | 5618.68] loss=3.14 avg=2.62\n","[4116 | 5620.27] loss=2.40 avg=2.61\n","[4117 | 5621.85] loss=2.80 avg=2.62\n","[4118 | 5623.43] loss=2.45 avg=2.61\n","[4119 | 5625.02] loss=2.83 avg=2.62\n","[4120 | 5626.61] loss=2.52 avg=2.61\n","[4121 | 5628.19] loss=0.08 avg=2.59\n","[4122 | 5629.78] loss=3.26 avg=2.60\n","[4123 | 5631.37] loss=2.46 avg=2.59\n","[4124 | 5632.96] loss=2.53 avg=2.59\n","[4125 | 5634.54] loss=2.41 avg=2.59\n","[4126 | 5636.12] loss=2.97 avg=2.60\n","[4127 | 5637.71] loss=2.82 avg=2.60\n","[4128 | 5639.29] loss=2.75 avg=2.60\n","[4129 | 5640.87] loss=2.58 avg=2.60\n","[4130 | 5642.46] loss=2.63 avg=2.60\n","[4131 | 5644.04] loss=2.36 avg=2.60\n","[4132 | 5645.63] loss=2.29 avg=2.59\n","[4133 | 5647.22] loss=2.86 avg=2.60\n","[4134 | 5648.81] loss=2.56 avg=2.60\n","[4135 | 5650.40] loss=3.14 avg=2.60\n","[4136 | 5651.98] loss=2.39 avg=2.60\n","[4137 | 5653.56] loss=2.36 avg=2.60\n","[4138 | 5655.15] loss=2.41 avg=2.60\n","[4139 | 5656.74] loss=3.19 avg=2.60\n","[4140 | 5658.33] loss=2.55 avg=2.60\n","[4141 | 5659.91] loss=3.17 avg=2.61\n","[4142 | 5661.50] loss=2.93 avg=2.61\n","[4143 | 5663.09] loss=2.83 avg=2.61\n","[4144 | 5664.68] loss=2.65 avg=2.61\n","[4145 | 5666.27] loss=2.79 avg=2.61\n","[4146 | 5667.86] loss=2.88 avg=2.62\n","[4147 | 5669.45] loss=2.73 avg=2.62\n","[4148 | 5671.05] loss=3.09 avg=2.62\n","[4149 | 5672.64] loss=2.70 avg=2.62\n","[4150 | 5674.23] loss=2.90 avg=2.63\n","[4151 | 5675.82] loss=2.25 avg=2.62\n","[4152 | 5677.41] loss=2.74 avg=2.62\n","[4153 | 5679.00] loss=2.76 avg=2.63\n","[4154 | 5680.60] loss=2.65 avg=2.63\n","[4155 | 5682.19] loss=2.27 avg=2.62\n","[4156 | 5683.78] loss=2.60 avg=2.62\n","[4157 | 5685.37] loss=1.00 avg=2.61\n","[4158 | 5686.96] loss=1.80 avg=2.60\n","[4159 | 5688.55] loss=3.00 avg=2.60\n","[4160 | 5690.15] loss=2.72 avg=2.60\n","[4161 | 5691.74] loss=2.46 avg=2.60\n","[4162 | 5693.33] loss=2.48 avg=2.60\n","[4163 | 5694.92] loss=2.97 avg=2.60\n","[4164 | 5696.50] loss=2.91 avg=2.61\n","[4165 | 5698.09] loss=2.68 avg=2.61\n","[4166 | 5699.68] loss=2.62 avg=2.61\n","[4167 | 5701.27] loss=2.98 avg=2.61\n","[4168 | 5702.86] loss=2.60 avg=2.61\n","[4169 | 5704.45] loss=2.66 avg=2.61\n","[4170 | 5706.04] loss=2.56 avg=2.61\n","[4171 | 5707.63] loss=3.16 avg=2.62\n","[4172 | 5709.22] loss=3.21 avg=2.62\n","[4173 | 5710.80] loss=2.87 avg=2.63\n","[4174 | 5712.40] loss=2.28 avg=2.62\n","[4175 | 5713.98] loss=1.90 avg=2.61\n","[4176 | 5715.58] loss=3.26 avg=2.62\n","[4177 | 5717.16] loss=2.74 avg=2.62\n","[4178 | 5718.76] loss=2.90 avg=2.62\n","[4179 | 5720.34] loss=3.19 avg=2.63\n","[4180 | 5721.93] loss=2.90 avg=2.63\n","[4181 | 5723.52] loss=2.17 avg=2.63\n","[4182 | 5725.11] loss=2.53 avg=2.63\n","[4183 | 5726.70] loss=3.01 avg=2.63\n","[4184 | 5728.29] loss=2.54 avg=2.63\n","[4185 | 5729.88] loss=2.53 avg=2.63\n","[4186 | 5731.47] loss=2.88 avg=2.63\n","[4187 | 5733.05] loss=3.09 avg=2.64\n","[4188 | 5734.64] loss=3.01 avg=2.64\n","[4189 | 5736.23] loss=2.58 avg=2.64\n","[4190 | 5737.82] loss=2.64 avg=2.64\n","[4191 | 5739.41] loss=2.69 avg=2.64\n","[4192 | 5741.00] loss=2.60 avg=2.64\n","[4193 | 5742.58] loss=2.84 avg=2.64\n","[4194 | 5744.17] loss=2.74 avg=2.64\n","[4195 | 5745.76] loss=2.54 avg=2.64\n","[4196 | 5747.34] loss=2.86 avg=2.64\n","[4197 | 5748.93] loss=2.53 avg=2.64\n","[4198 | 5750.51] loss=2.49 avg=2.64\n","[4199 | 5752.10] loss=3.16 avg=2.65\n","Generating samples...\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n","Kickley said she was shocked and appalled.\n","\"I was at a loss for words to express my disappointment and indignation that anyone and everyone that believed in our cause would make such a statement,\" she said. \"If this truly is what you think it is, please understand that, in my time, being a professional soldier, I would have killed you and your crew, had I been allowed to without warning, which, I would not have hesitated to do.\n","\n","“I’m sure the shooter was angry at the sight of a US soldier, someone he had fought against in the past, and I will do everything in my power to help bring those responsible to justice.

In the past few days, you might remember the rumors of Xbox 360 and PlayStation Three. I know many of the people behind those. They're also going to want to know what Microsoft is planning - if any will come to market as planned - both as a console manufacturer and also part of a brand that is being sold both in the U.S. and around the world.\n","But for those of us who have been following all the news and rumors about next-gen consoles - and for those of us who have been hoping that some sort of a \"console revolution\" (and also perhaps some sort of brand refresh and re-branding) would happen - what we have seen so far has only served to fill the gaps that have been left in our knowledge of how to tell console stories.\n","We've had good news, we've had bad news. But we have also had bad news. We've seen news that the Xbox 360 and PS3 are on their way to market, and we've also seen news that a new generation of console may not happen until sometime in the next 12-18 months. But what's also been lacking is news that there's such a thing as a bad news and a good news...\n","What we have, so far, has been a little of both.\n","<|endoftext|>A Good Game Can Be A Very Special Game\n","Author: Luke Plunkett\n","<image_or_gif>\n","I’ve played a fair few games lately, all of them small, all of them under $10. And I’ve also played a fair few games that I think are absolutely worth your time, if you just watch, listen and play. And in a lot of those games, there’s a good game I don’t fully understand. \n","<image_or_gif>\n","If you haven’t seen a lot of Kotaku lately, you haven’t paid attention. Maybe it’s because everything we write sounds a little different, and we’re more of a press-skeptic operation. Or something. Whatever the case... I do enjoy Kotaku, though I don’t quite get the enthusiasm around a few of the things we've written.\n","<gif_or_video>\n","Sometimes I think I’d really like it if we stopped and really took a look across the board at all the games we cover. Think of a big industry - AAA, open-world, first-person shooters - and how those games shape our view of the genre. \n","If you’re more into puzzle-platforming and indie RPGs, well, you may be a little more interested in Kotaku. But that’s OK because we cover a very broad range of games. We cover a diverse, if less well-rounded, range of stories, and we cover a range of styles, from retro-futuristic to contemporary.\n","If, though, you’re just into action games, that’s fine, too. But even if you can put that idea into words, I think the best comparison we can make is a game like Deus Ex, which I think is a great game that probably isn’t as well-known as some of the other games in its genre, if not the genre itself. \n","<image_or_gif>\n","Now, to the point I just made. You watch games and you want to know why a certain game ended up playing so well (no pun intended). And, sure, I could give you a number of reasons: it might have been great as a single episode in a movie, or just good enough to fill a brief trailer and get a great review, but in the long run, that's just not an answer. I’ve been playing games since the Super Nintendo, and playing games, well, it doesn’t seem to bother me that much.

If we can't get along, we'll always have fun fighting on the opposite side of the battlefront. We're always looking out for one another. Sometimes it's because we disagree, but most of the time it's because we're in league to see who can get the closest and most epic clash of war.\n","There is not much to do in Battlefield 4. The city of London isn't very big, but it's still the largest in the world, and that's an important thing to remember if you're going to be playing at an American Battlefield 2 level. The city is littered with the most ridiculous landmarks you can imagine - it doesn't get much more American than that, that's for sure.\n","You can find yourself in London in multiplayer, but not in single player, because you won't have the luxury of respawning. Instead, you'll get to choose where the game ends once you've been through the main story.

I’m also not very good at video games, so I’m not much of a gamer, but still the idea of making videos about “Sora on his adventures has popped into my head and I started playing him and he seems to have so much new ideas.”\n","<image_or_gif>\n","But yeah, I decided to create this fanon and that’s why I’m putting this here instead of somewhere else.\n","You can read my thoughts on how this went down here:\n","<image_or_gif>\n","The reason, I’ve got a lot of different ideas for some of the things. I’m not the only one who’d like to have something like “Sora’s” come to life. I’ve also read lots of fanon and made a few changes like “Sora” being a big girl’s show rather than a boy’s show, and “Sora” getting along with a lot of other shows that weren’t so big.\n","Anyway, you can find the official art that's been used to do the fanon on DeviantArt: http://imgur.com/a/iQmqY\n","<image_or_gif>\n","If you like what you see, you can support me on Patreon and get some awesome rewards!\n","<|endoftext|>PlayStation Vita Comes Out On Monday\n","Author: Jason Schreier\n","<image_or_gif>\n","The PlayStation Vita will arrive this Monday, November 11 for 1,300 yen (about US$20). The game, like most Vita releases, will go on sale on Thursday.\n","The Vita was first announced back in 2008, and was soon confirmed as an official PlayStation 3 home console—not to be confused, as some fans have been playing it for years after being aware of it—but was never officially announced until this year. It’s a console so large that you barely notice it, only needing to look a few feet in the direction of a TV to see what you’re in for.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","It’s a portable console like the Wii, which I didn’t really want, but nonetheless love. I’ve gotten the impression that the Vita is going to be a very different beast than the Wii, even though the game I’ve read about is still fairly low-level.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","The game will be sold with games for both the DS and PSP. Sony has promised no hard sales to the DS, but has confirmed that it will give away a bundle of two games. I can’t say which games. I’ve checked the official website for the bundle, and will update it if it doesn’t appear.\n","<image_or_gif>\n","I can’t wait.\n","<|endoftext|>Kotaku\n","Author: Cecilia\n","\n","[4700 | 6677.35] loss=2.75 avg=2.67\n","[4701 | 6678.93] loss=2.70 avg=2.67\n","[4702 | 6680.53] loss=2.83 avg=2.67\n","[4703 | 6682.11] loss=1.48 avg=2.66\n","[4704 | 6683.70] loss=2.37 avg=2.66\n","[4705 | 6685.28] loss=3.16 avg=2.66\n","[4706 | 6686.87] loss=2.57 avg=2.66\n","[4707 | 6688.45] loss=2.99 avg=2.67\n","[4708 | 6690.04] loss=2.11 avg=2.66\n","[4709 | 6691.62] loss=3.42 avg=2.67\n","[4710 | 6693.21] loss=2.00 avg=2.66\n","[4711 | 6694.79] loss=2.88 avg=2.66\n","[4712 | 6696.38] loss=3.33 avg=2.67\n","[4713 | 6697.97] loss=2.16 avg=2.67\n","[4714 | 6699.55] loss=3.16 avg=2.67\n","[4715 | 6701.13] loss=2.82 avg=2.67\n","[4716 | 6702.70] loss=2.73 avg=2.67\n","[4717 | 6704.29] loss=2.34 avg=2.67\n","[4718 | 6705.88] loss=2.85 avg=2.67\n","[4719 | 6707.47] loss=2.89 avg=2.67\n","[4720 | 6709.06] loss=2.61 avg=2.67\n","[4721 | 6710.64] loss=1.11 avg=2.66\n","[4722 | 6712.24] loss=2.79 avg=2.66\n","[4723 | 6713.82] loss=2.72 avg=2.66\n","[4724 | 6715.40] loss=2.59 avg=2.66\n","[4725 | 6716.98] loss=2.16 avg=2.65\n","[4726 | 6718.58] loss=2.69 avg=2.65\n","[4727 | 6720.15] loss=2.50 avg=2.65\n","[4728 | 6721.74] loss=2.28 avg=2.65\n","[4729 | 6723.33] loss=2.50 avg=2.65\n","[4730 | 6724.92] loss=3.12 avg=2.65\n","[4731 | 6726.51] loss=2.80 avg=2.65\n","[4732 | 6728.10] loss=2.94 avg=2.66\n","[4733 | 6729.69] loss=2.46 avg=2.65\n","[4734 | 6731.28] loss=2.85 avg=2.66\n","[4735 | 6732.87] loss=1.86 avg=2.65\n","[4736 | 6734.45] loss=2.57 avg=2.65\n","[4737 | 6736.04] loss=2.00 avg=2.64\n","[4738 | 6737.63] loss=2.36 avg=2.64\n","[4739 | 6739.22] loss=2.67 avg=2.64\n","[4740 | 6740.81] loss=2.27 avg=2.64\n","[4741 | 6742.40] loss=2.34 avg=2.63\n","[4742 | 6743.99] loss=2.61 avg=2.63\n","[4743 | 6745.58] loss=2.17 avg=2.63\n","[4744 | 6747.17] loss=2.45 avg=2.63\n","[4745 | 6748.76] loss=2.95 avg=2.63\n","interrupted\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-4746\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vS1RJJDFOPnb","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Save our checkpoints to start training again later"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JretqG1zOXdi","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!cp -r /content/gpt-2/checkpoint/ /content/drive/My\\ Drive/"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6D-i7vERWbNS","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Load your trained model for use in sampling below (117M or 345M)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VeETvWvrbKga","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!cp -r /content/gpt-2/checkpoint/run1/* /content/gpt-2/models/117M/"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"np0r6qfXBeUX","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!cp -r /content/gpt-2/checkpoint/run1/* /content/gpt-2/models/345M/"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GmnSrXqtfRbq","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Generate conditional samples from the model given a prompt you provide -  change top-k hyperparameter if desired (default is 40),  if you're using 345M, add \"--model-name 345M\""]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"utJj-iY4gHwE","colab_type":"code","outputId":"655d5c09-194f-43be-81d8-bc5f10046b70","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1567439726746,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":32238,"user":{"displayName":"Дмитрий Десяткин","photoUrl":"","userId":"09234037724360396171"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000}},"source":["!python3 src/interactive_conditional_samples.py --top_k 100 --model_name \"345M\" --nsamples=10"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING: Logging before flag parsing goes to stderr.\n","W0902 12:51:56.282799 139857910781824 deprecation_wrapper.py:119] From /content/gpt-2/src/model.py:147: The name tf.AUTO_REUSE is deprecated.

Episode 3 is darker than its predecessor through a choice of atmospheric, atmospheric lighting, enhanced environments, and dramatic cinematic sets. In particular, the environment itself has been fully recreated, with special attention to character detail, weather, lighting, and every detail of environment, texture, sound.\n","Here's a rundown on seven important things you'll notice that your group doesn't see today - the atmosphere, characters, environments, and the cinematics.\n","7. Character Visuals\n","\"Half-Life has always been a fantasy world and Valve has always had that.\"\n","What are new?

New environments - notably a better sky, a fuller and more populated atmosphere, and more plants.\n","8. The More New, The Better\n","New environments, lighting, and characters are important. They are the backbone to Episode 3's character and world. But by making more important of the \"New\" in the title of Episode 3, Valve are hoping to make Episode 3 a better, more dramatic game—and in doing that, the game's narrative as well.\n","\"In previous games, you would see people dying and dying, we are making that more interesting,\" said Gabe Newell. \"We wanted to show you these people [that are] walking [through] the Portal, you have been walking for many years, and to even do that in some light, make it hard for you to move? Well if we can make life more intense, make you do things within Portal with your time-limit, the game feels more alive too.\"\n","Those \"time-limiting\" sections of Portal could change the way you explore the game; imagine taking an active role in the game; interacting with the enemies and making it easier to travel through.\n","And there's more. \"We want to keep that part of the game,\" said CFO Larry Probst. \"It's already there, you've been sitting in a chair in a Valve studio, we know what you like, and we want to keep making you care about our product\n","======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================\n",": Episode 3, which looks impressive.

I didn't want to sound trite, and I didn't want to do it right after watching The Avengers, either. I just wanted to tell a story. It never occurred to me, however, to try to fit my love for the series into a single franchise. I'm a big fan of JRPGs, but I'd rather spend time with games that I love than ones I like.

Here the player character is a boy searching for an idol and to live within the confines of one's school, family, or church, while simultaneously building friendship and belonging in society. Although my childhood was filled with Disney princess movies and princesses from other series, Stardew Valley does a much better job of having the \"family\" feel of a family. It's a familiar game atmosphere without the awkwardness of being an outsider and/or a part of the group.\n","\n","<image_or_gif>\n"," Family relations are handled in the game through family events. At very least, there are events to do in the game to interact with people outside of friends and family.

You can also engage in family tree-esque events to share in that tree. Family events include a weekly card game in which you get a card each week from your family tree, a holiday party that includes all your family, and a family dinner. You might come home after a long day to find your kids having dinner at your house, or maybe after a long work day, they've decided to celebrate a new day at your house.

And, yes, it's incredibly challenging at some of the higher levels (the player was able to slay multiple giant daemons in a single run!)\n","The battle system in this game—the way you move your characters around—is more of a result of the direction than of the ideas at hand.

Games like Metal Gear Solid and Braid have had hundreds of thousands of dollars invested by hardcore gamers. The studio has spent millions on a game where the main characters are really cut-outs who look like you. Every time we try something new, we need to play it through from beginning to end to make sure things work.

Their publisher, Naughty Dog, decided to change a deal they had with Microsoft to give the producer a certain amount of money based on how much it is in revenue for one year, for example.\n","Naughty Dog felt it needed a little more money to be able to make the Uncharted series. At this point, however, the first video games, which are the most successful, tend to be multi-million dollar franchises.

So at the tail end of this month we get the game we knew most about but felt was the weakest in its genre: a cutely anthropomorphic mummy.\n","The adorable little mummy is a plush mama's doll from Animal Crossing that's dressed the same as the main character. The idea makes a lot of more than cute; it's one of the most anticipated games of the year.\n","Unlike Mario Maker it's a touch-based game, a more traditional Animal Crossing approach to making things.

There's the possibility there could also be some elements from Xbox Live Arcade's Alien vs Predator or Gears of War 2, but that is very much speculation at this point.\n","If PS3's Half-Life were to be released on the PlayStation for the first time, that would have to be as good as it gets, right?\n","...it would be amazing!

The current age of first-person shooters is largely due to people demanding more that guns and jumping. Something could happen to the business model or license to make the game a PS3 exclusivity game.\n","Maybe the developer isn't interested in doing the game anyway? Maybe they do want to make the PS3 version of a computer game, but only if they can sell more of it at retail for under two dollars. Maybe that is the way games are made, however. We still don't know.\n","Why would publishers make a new game from a franchise that is now 40 years old?\n","What would it change about the game - would it make it more complicated? More challenging?
